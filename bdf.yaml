  name: STARR Oncology Multi-modal Data Lake
  description: |-
    A unified data lake integrating oncology-relevant datasets at Stanford from EHR, Imaging, and Registry for research and modeling. 
    Unless specified, the dataset is a BigQuery dataset with strict access control for IRB approved users. 
    A subset of the research team, the PIs and superusers, have access to the PHI dataset and everyone in the IRB have access to the PHI scrubbed versions. 
    Note that PHI scrubbed versions are not granted de-identification determination, they are deemed Stanford High Risk data. 
    Only Stanford UPO can provide Expert Determination for data de-identification.
  dataset:
    - name: Stanford Cancer Registry (SCR) via Neural Frame KACI
      description: |-
        Patients for whom Stanford abstracts data and submits to California Cancer Registry. 
        Includes both analytical and non-analytical cases. Non-analytical cases are included since 2024. 
        Nearly all thoracic cancer patients who went to tumor board are included in Stanford Cancer Registry. 
        The Knowledge Assistant for Clinical Information (KACI) database used for SCR is managed by Neural Frame. 
        This dataset is derived from Neural Frame provided database dump.

    - name: Oncology OMOP cohort
      description: |-
        Oncology patients with data transformed to OHDSI OMOP CDM v5.3. 
        Our primary approach has been to build a subset of STARR OMOP for patients who are in the Stanford Cancer Registry. 
        STARR OMOP contains research patients from Stanford ecosystem of hospitals.

    - name: Genetic testing structured data
      description: |-
        This dataset is derived from Philips ISPM database. 
        Philips ISPM abstracts genetic aberration data from PDFs that are forwarded to their system. 
        It contains structured data for a subset of Stanford lab tests (STAMP) and external tests from Foundation One.

    - name: Radiology DICOM data
      description: |-
        This dataset is not-standalone dataset, but instead is linked to the Oncology OMOP Cohort via the image_occurence table. 
        The local_path in the image_occurence table points to the GCS bucket where the associated DICOMs for _accession_number are stored.
