As of January 2022, the KACI® application from NeuralFrame was approved for abstracting and transmitting diagnosed cases, with Stanford adopting it in 2023. Neural Frame connects to EPIC to extract relevant data, including pathology notes.\nWithin Neural Frame, Class of Case (CoC) divides cases into two groups: cancer cases are categorized as Analytic (reportable with complete data) or Non-analytic (not reportable by law, with complete data only from 2022 onward).\n\nAnalytic: Analytic cases include patients with initial diagnoses and full or partial treatments at Stanford. Analytic cases (codes 00-22) are those that are required by CoC to be abstracted because of the program’s primary responsibility in managing the cancer. Analytic cases are grouped according to the location of diagnosis and treatment.\nNon-analytic: Non-analytic cases include recurrences, consults only, and in-transit patients. Non-analytic cases (codes 30-49 and 99) can be abstracted by the facility to fulfill central registry requirements or upon request from the facility’s cancer program. The grouping of non-analytic cases is based on the reason for their classification, whether they received care at the facility or were abstracted for other reasons.",

As of January 2022, the KACI® application from NeuralFrame was approved for abstracting and transmitting diagnosed cases, with Stanford adopting it in 2023. Neural Frame connects to EPIC to extract relevant data, including pathology notes.\nWithin Neural Frame, Class of Case (CoC) divides cases into two groups: cancer cases are categorized as Analytic (reportable with complete data) or Non-analytic (not reportable by law, with complete data only from 2022 onward).\n\nAnalytic: Analytic cases include patients with initial diagnoses and full or partial treatments at Stanford. Analytic cases (codes 00-22) are those that are required by CoC to be abstracted because of the program’s primary responsibility in managing the cancer. Analytic cases are grouped according to the location of diagnosis and treatment.\nNon-analytic: Non-analytic cases include recurrences, consults only, and in-transit patients. Non-analytic cases (codes 30-49 and 99) can be abstracted by the facility to fulfill central registry requirements or upon request from the facility’s cancer program. The grouping of non-analytic cases is based on the reason for their classification, whether they received care at the facility or were abstracted for other reasons.",

Developed over 35 years ago to address significant variability in cancer reporting, these evidence-based protocols ensure complete, uniform documentation of malignant tumors across all healthcare institutions, directly improving patient outcomes and clinical decision-making.\nLung resection CAP forms are particularly critical in thoracic oncology, providing standardized reporting templates for primary lung cancers that include essential elements such as tumor size, histologic type and grade, surgical margins, lymph node status, and staging classifications. These lung-specific protocols have demonstrated measurable clinical impact, with studies showing that synoptic reporting achieves 88.4% completeness compared to only 2.6% for traditional descriptive reports, leading to more accurate staging, better treatment planning, and improved survival rates.\nBy establishing consistent terminology and data capture requirements, CAP lung resection forms enhance communication between pathologists and oncologists, ensure regulatory compliance with Commission on Cancer standards, and provide the structured data foundation necessary for personalized cancer care, targeted therapy selection, and multidisciplinary treatment coordination. The widespread adoption of these standardized protocols, supported by electronic integration into laboratory information systems, has positioned pathologists as key members of the lung cancer care team while enabling seamless data exchange for cancer registries, research, and quality improvement initiatives.",

    "text": "Methods and Results\nFor this experiment, we used several state-of-the-art LLMs to assess their capabilities to extract the information required for lung resection CAP forms. As mentioned before, we formulated the problem as a question-answering problem. The full set of top level questions for the Lung Resection CAP forms alongside the descriptions for each one of them can be found here. Each LLM was tested in a zero-shot setting, where no actual examples were given. Each LLM was asked to answer a single question using the entire pathology report (excluding the synoptic report) and instructions that contained the most recent lung resection CAP forms instructions. We asked the LLMs to provide the answers using JSON to facilitate the parsing of the actual answers. The prompt used can be found here.\nTo automatically evaluate the output, we used the traditional BERT score, which evaluates the semantic similarity between the generated answer and the reference answer. Distribution of average BERT scores across models is shown below. Histograms with dashed median lines indicate a minor differences in central tendency and variability between models. Summary statistics (mean, median, quartiles) are provided as follow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCategory-Based Evaluation of LLMs\nTo enable structured evaluation, individual questions from the lung resection CAP forms were grouped into high-level categories based on clinical relevance and reporting conventions. Each category represents a logical grouping of related questions that capture similar aspects of lung resection pathology. This approach allowed us to assess model performance at both the individual-question and category level (e.g., how well LLMs capture margin information overall) and facilitated clearer identification of domains where AI assistance may be most beneficial to pathologists (e.g., strong performance in Margins vs. weaker performance in Histologic Grade). The categories were defined as follow:\n\nSpecimen & Procedure\nInformation about the surgical specimen and procedure, including specimen ID, laterality, and general notes.\n\nLUNG || SPECIMEN ID(S)\n\nPROCEDURE\n\nSPECIMEN LATERALITY\n\nSYNCHRONOUS TUMORS (REQUIRED IF MORPHOLOGICALLY DISTINCT UNRELATED MULTIPLE PRIMARY TUMORS ARE PRESENT)\n\nNOTE\n\n\n\nTumor Size, Focality, Distribution\nDetails on tumor dimensions, number of nodules, total and invasive sizes, focality, and presence of synchronous tumors.\n\nLUNG || ADDITIONAL DIMENSION (CENTIMETERS)\n\nLUNG || NUMBER OF INTRAPULMONARY METASTASES\n\nLUNG || TOTAL NUMBER OF PRIMARY TUMORS\n\nTOTAL TUMOR SIZE (SIZE OF ENTIRE TUMOR)\n\nSIZE OF INVASIVE COMPONENT (REQUIRED ONLY IF INVASIVE NONMUCINOUS ADENOCARCINOMAS WITH LEPIDIC COMPO)\n\nTUMOR FOCALITY\n\nNUMBER OF TUMOR NODULES\n\nTUMOR SITE\n\nPERCENTAGE OF TOTAL TUMOR SIZE (ABOVE)\n\n\n\nTumor Histology & Subtypes\nHistologic type, grade, patterns, components, and any descriptive comments from the pathologist.\n\nHISTOLOGIC TYPE (NOTE A)\n\nHISTOLOGIC TYPE (NOTE C)\n\nLUNG || HISTOLOGIC TYPE COMMENT\n\nHISTOLOGIC GRADE\n\nHISTOLOGIC PATTERNS (MAY INCLUDE PERCENTAGES)\n\nHISTOLOGIC COMPONENT(S) PRESENT (MAY INCLUDE PERCENTAGES)\n\nLUNG || COMMENT(S)\n\n\n\nLocal Extension & Invasion\nExtent of tumor spread, including invasion of adjacent structures, visceral pleura, lymphovascular spaces, and STAS.\n\nDIRECT INVASION OF OTHER STRUCTURES\n\nINVOLVED ADJACENT STRUCTURES\n\nVISCERAL PLEURA INVASION\n\nLYMPHOVASCULAR INVASION\n\nLYMPHOVASCULAR INVASION (NOTE F)\n\nSPREAD THROUGH AIR SPACES (STAS)\n\n\n\nRegional Lymph Nodes & Distant Metastisis\nNodal involvement, number of nodes examined and positive, prior lymph node procedures, and extranodal extension.\n\nDISTANT SITE(S) INVOLVED, IF APPLICABLE\nLUNG || PRIOR LYMPH NODE PROCEDURE(S) INCLUDED\n\nLUNG || REGIONAL LYMPH NODE COMMENT\n\nLYMPH NODE(S) FROM PRIOR PROCEDURES\n\nNUMBER OF LYMPH NODES EXAMINED\n\nNUMBER OF LYMPH NODES WITH TUMOR\n\nREGIONAL LYMPH NODE STATUS\n\nREGIONAL LYMPH NODES\n\nREGIONAL LYMPH NODES (PN)\n\nNODAL SITE(S) EXAMINED\n\nNODAL SITE(S) WITH TUMOR\n\nEXTRANODAL EXTENSION\n\n\n\nMargins\nStatus and distance of surgical margins (bronchial, vascular, parenchymal, pleural) and comments.\n\nCLOSEST MARGIN(S) TO INVASIVE CARCINOMA\n\nDISTANCE FROM INVASIVE CARCINOMA TO CLOSEST MARGIN\n\nLUNG || MARGIN COMMENT\n\nMARGIN STATUS FOR INVASIVE CARCINOMA\n\nMARGIN STATUS FOR NON-INVASIVE TUMOR\n\nMARGIN(S) INVOLVED BY INVASIVE CARCINOMA\n\n\n\nStaging (AJCC/UICC)\nAJCC/UICC TNM descriptors and categories (pT, pN, pM) for pathologic staging.\n\nPRIMARY TUMOR (PT)\n\nPN CATEGORY\n\nPM CATEGORY (REQUIRED ONLY IF CONFIRMED PATHOLOGICALLY)\n\nTNM DESCRIPTORS\n\n\n\nTreatment Effect\nEvidence of therapy response, including necrosis, viable tumor, and stromal changes.\n\nTREATMENT EFFECT\n\nTREATMENT EFFECT (NOTE I)\n\nPERCENTAGE OF NECROSIS\n\nPERCENTAGE OF RESIDUAL VIABLE TUMOR\n\nPERCENTAGE OF STROMA (INCLUDES FIBROSIS AND INFLAMMATION)\n\n\n\nAdditional Findings\nAdditional findings and miscellaneous notes not captured in other categories\n\nADDITIONAL FINDINGS\n\n\n\nModel Performance Across Clinical Categories\nThe following boxplot displays the distribution of BERT scores across clinical categories, combining data from all three models (OpenAI OSS, Gemini, and LLama4). Categories are sorted by median performance, with the vertical dotted line at 0.85 representing the clinical acceptance threshold. Higher scores (further right) indicate better performance in extracting and structuring the relevant clinical information from pathology reports.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel Performance by Category\nIn addition, we assessed model performance across clinical categories using median BERT similarity scores. The following table summarizes median BERT F1-scores for each model across high-level categories. For each category, the model with the highest median score is flagged in the “Best Model” column, highlighting domain-specific strengths. This comparison enables quick identification of areas where models excel and areas where performance is more competitive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCross-Model Comparisons Analysis\nWe evaluated the comparative performance of three large language models (OpenAI OSS, Gemini, and Llama4) across multiple clinical documentation categories, with results presented as vertical bar plots. Each plot depicts category-level performance using color-coded bars: high performance (median BERT score ≥ 0.85), medium performance (0.75–0.84), and low performance (&lt; 0.75). A dotted grey reference line marks the 0.85 threshold, providing a visual benchmark for clinically relevant accuracy.\nOpenAI OSS\nOpenAI OSS demonstrated the strongest performance, with a majority of categories exceeding the 0.85 threshold. Performance was particularly high in Local Extension and Invasion, Tumor Size, and Margins, suggesting greater robustness in structured oncologic reporting tasks. Overall, OpenAI OSS achieved the highest number of high-performance categories, indicating superior generalizability across clinical contexts.\nGemini\nGemini exhibited more consistent, though less exceptional, performance. The model performed best in Specimen & Procedure and Tumor Size, and Regional Lymph Nodes. While fewer categories reached the ≥ 0.85 threshold compared to OpenAI OSS, Gemini maintained steady medium performance across most categories, reflecting reliability without as many peak performances.\nLLama4\nLLama4 showed greater variability across categories. While achieving strong results in Specimen and Procedure, it underperformed relative to the other models, with more categories falling below the 0.75 threshold. These results suggest LLama4 may be more sensitive to domain-specific nuances rather than broadly adaptable.\nSeveral trends emerged across models. All models struggled with Tumor Histology and Staging, indicating this category may represent a systematic challenge in clinical text modeling. Conversely, categories with the highest performance were largely consistent across models, reinforcing reproducibility of strengths across architectures. Taken together, a performance hierarchy was evident: OpenAI OSS &gt; Gemini &gt; LLama4.\n\nModel: OpenAI OSSModel: GeminiModel: Llama4",

    "text": "Summary\nIn this evaluation we only use 3 models vs the 5 presented before. We choose to use the open source version of GPT to favor open source models with more recent data cuts. It has been shown that this model is particularly good at health related tasks. All models were use through Google Cloud using their Vertex AI HIPAA compliant deployments and endpoints. The models endpoints used were: openai/gpt-oss-20b-maas for OpenAI OSS, gemini-2.5-flash for the latest Gemini model and meta/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct-maas for the latest LLAMA model.\nAcross the nine categories, OpenAI OSS achieved the highest overall success rate (56%), most frequently exceeding the 0.85 threshold. In contrast, Gemini demonstrated consistent performance across categories, ranking highest in Specimen & Procedure, and Staging compared to the other models. Llama4 showed more balanced but slightly weaker results overall.\nTaken together, OpenAI OSS appears strongest in terms of peak performance across domains, while Gemini offers steadier and broader consistency even if some medians fell below the threshhold, and Llama4 provides competitive performance in select categories.\nLastly, we piloted an LLM-as-a-Judge experiment to assess whether model-generated answers aligned with CAP form reference answers. While promising, this approach requires further refinement and validation with expert pathologist annotations before it can be considered an objective and reliable measure of performance.",

    "text": "CAP (College of American Pathologists) forms are standardized cancer reporting protocols that have revolutionized pathology practice by replacing inconsistent narrative reports with structured, synoptic formats containing essential diagnostic and prognostic information. Developed over 35 years ago to address significant variability in cancer reporting, these evidence-based protocols ensure complete, uniform documentation of malignant tumors across all healthcare institutions, directly improving patient outcomes and clinical decision-making.\nLung resection CAP forms are particularly critical in thoracic oncology, providing standardized reporting templates for primary lung cancers that include essential elements such as tumor size, histologic type and grade, surgical margins, lymph node status, and staging classifications. These lung-specific protocols have demonstrated measurable clinical impact, with studies showing that synoptic reporting achieves 88.4% completeness compared to only 2.6% for traditional descriptive reports, leading to more accurate staging, better treatment planning, and improved survival rates.\nBy establishing consistent terminology and data capture requirements, CAP lung resection forms enhance communication between pathologists and oncologists, ensure regulatory compliance with Commission on Cancer standards, and provide the structured data foundation necessary for personalized cancer care, targeted therapy selection, and multidisciplinary treatment coordination. The widespread adoption of these standardized protocols, supported by electronic integration into laboratory information systems, has positioned pathologists as key members of the lung cancer care team while enabling seamless data exchange for cancer registries, research, and quality improvement initiatives.\nAt Stanford, CAP forms were implemented within Epic using SmartForms. SmartForms is an Epic product that allows the capture of semi-structured information within the EHR that can later be used to generate free-form reports. In this case, the structured information from the CAP forms is captured on SmartForms, which later generate the synoptic reporting section within the pathology report. As a consequence, for relevant cases, the pathology report will contain this section.\nFor this task, we aim to use AI to populate the CAP forms automatically by using all the other elements from the pathology report. We formulated this as a question-answering problem, where the context for each question is the entire pathology report, the question is the particular CAP form element, and the answer is the value/selection to be populated.\nFor this initial experiment, we collected a dataset with 390 patients and 390 lung resection forms. The forms were reported between November 2022 and April 2025.

    "text": "Methods and Results\nFor this experiment, we used several state-of-the-art LLMs to assess their capabilities to extract the information required for lung resection CAP forms. As mentioned before, we formulated the problem as a question-answering problem. Each LLM was tested in a zero-shot setting, where no actual examples were given. Each LLM was asked to answer a single question using the entire pathology report (excluding the synoptic report) and instructions that contained the most recent lung resection CAP forms instructions. We asked the LLMs to provide the answers using JSON to facilitate the parsing of the actual answers.\nTo automatically evaluate the output, we used the traditional BERT score, which evaluates the semantic similarity between the generated answer and the reference answer. The results of this evaluation are shown in the figure below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, we can see that Claude 3.7 is slightly better than Llama 4. However, the distribution for most LLMs is certainly wide, showing lack of consistency across all questions. To investigate this further, a heatmap was constructed and is shown in the figure below. Here, we can clearly see the variability across different questions and how GPT-4 consistently underperforms for this particular task. The questions itself and the descriptions of each question can be found below the graph.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCAP Form Questions\n\nADDITIONAL FINDINGS - Documents other pathologic findings in the specimen beyond the primary tumor, such as atypical adenomatous hyperplasia, granulomatous inflammation, or emphysema.\n\nCLOSEST MARGIN(S) TO INVASIVE CARCINOMA - Identifies which specific surgical margin (bronchial, vascular, parenchymal, or chest wall) is nearest to the invasive tumor.\n\nDISTANCE FROM INVASIVE CARCINOMA TO CLOSEST MARGIN - Measures in centimeters how far the invasive tumor extends from the nearest surgical margin.\n\nHISTOLOGIC GRADE - Assesses the degree of tumor differentiation using grading schemes specific to tumor type (G1-well differentiated to G4-undifferentiated).\n\nLYMPH NODE(S) FROM PRIOR PROCEDURES - Documents whether lymph nodes from previous surgical procedures are included in the current specimen.\n\nLYMPHOVASCULAR INVASION - Reports the presence of tumor cells within lymphatic vessels, arteries, or veins.\n\nMARGIN STATUS FOR INVASIVE CARCINOMA - Determines whether invasive tumor is present at any surgical margin or if all margins are negative.\n\nMARGIN STATUS FOR NON-INVASIVE TUMOR - Assesses whether carcinoma in situ or lepidic components are present at surgical margins.\n\nNODAL SITE(S) EXAMINED - Documents which specific lymph node stations according to the IASLC map were sampled and examined.\n\nNODAL SITE(S) WITH TUMOR - Identifies which specific lymph node stations contain metastatic tumor.\n\nNUMBER OF LYMPH NODES EXAMINED - Provides the total count of lymph nodes examined in the specimen.\n\nNUMBER OF LYMPH NODES WITH TUMOR - Reports the count of lymph nodes containing metastatic tumor.\n\nPROCEDURE - Specifies the type of surgical resection performed (wedge resection, lobectomy, pneumonectomy, etc.).\n\nREGIONAL LYMPH NODE STATUS - Provides overall assessment of whether regional lymph nodes contain tumor or are negative.\n\nSPECIMEN LATERALITY - Indicates whether the lung specimen is from the right or left side.\n\nSPREAD THROUGH AIR SPACES (STAS) - Documents the presence of tumor cells extending beyond the main tumor into surrounding air spaces as micropapillary clusters, solid nests, or single cells.\n\nTNM DESCRIPTORS - Assigns pathologic TNM staging categories (pT, pN, pM) based on tumor size, nodal involvement, and distant metastasis.\n\nTOTAL TUMOR SIZE (SIZE OF ENTIRE TUMOR) - Measures the greatest dimension of the entire tumor including both invasive and non-invasive components.\n\nTUMOR FOCALITY - Determines whether there is a single tumor focus, multiple separate nodules, or multifocal disease.\n\nTUMOR SITE - Identifies the specific anatomic location of the tumor within the lung (upper lobe, lower lobe, bronchus, etc.).\n\nVISCERAL PLEURA INVASION - Assesses whether tumor penetrates beyond the elastic layer of the visceral pleura or extends to the pleural surface.\n\nFurther investigation is required to evaluate and characterize the failure modes of each of the LLMs. Additionally, the baseline performance indicates that fine-tuning an open-source model like Llama 4 may yield better results.",

Although not required for accreditation, they may be considered for reporting.\n\n              This protocol is not required for recurrent or metastatic tumors resected at a different time than the primary tumor. This protocol is also not required for pathology reviews performed at a second institution (i.e., second opinion and referrals to another institution).\n              Full accreditation requirements can be found on the CAP website under [Accreditation Checklists](https://www.cap.org/laboratory-improvement/accreditation/accreditation-checklists).\n              A list of core and conditional data elements can be found in the Summary of Required Elements under Resources on the CAP Cancer Protocols [website](https://www.cap.org/protocols-and-guidelines/cancer-reporting-tools/cancer-protocol-templates).\n              *\\*Includes definitive primary cancer resection and pediatric biopsy tumor types.*\n\n              **Synoptic Reporting**\n              All core and conditionally required data elements outlined on the surgical case summary from this cancer protocol must be displayed in synoptic report format.

The response for any data element may be modified from those listed in the case summary, including “Cannot be determined” if appropriate.\n              * Each diagnostic parameter pair (Data element: Response) is listed on a separate line or in a tabular format to achieve visual separation. The following exceptions are allowed to be listed on one line:\n              * Anatomic site or specimen, laterality, and procedure\n              * Pathologic Stage Classification (pTNM) elements\n              * Negative margins, as long as all negative margins are specifically enumerated where applicable\n              * The synoptic portion of the report can appear in the diagnosis section of the pathology report, at the end of the report or in a separate section, but all Data element: Responses must be listed together in one location\n              * Organizations and pathologists may choose to list the required elements in any order, use additional methods in order to enhance or achieve visual separation, or add optional items within the synoptic report. The report may have required elements in a summary format elsewhere in the report IN ADDITION TO but not as replacement for the synoptic report i.e., all required elements must be in the synoptic portion of the report in the format defined above.\n\n\n              **Reporting Template**\n              **Protocol Posting Date:** December 2024\n              **Select a single response unless otherwise indicated.**\n              **CASE SUMMARY: (LUNG) **\n              **Standard(s)**: AJCC 9\n\n              **SPECIMEN **\n\n              **Synchronous Tumors (required if morphologically distinct unrelated multiple primary tumors are present) **\n              \\_\\_\\_ Not applicable \n              *\\# Morphologically distinct tumors that are considered to represent separate primary lung cancers should have separate synoptic reports *\n              \\_\\_\\_ Present\\# \n              **Total Number of Primary Tumors: \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_**\n              **Specimen ID(s): \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_**\n              \\_\\_\\_ Cannot be determined \n\n              **Procedure (select all that apply)**\n              \\_\\_\\_ Wedge resection \n              \\_\\_\\_ Segmentectomy \n              \\_\\_\\_ Lobectomy \n              \\_\\_\\_ Completion lobectomy \n              \\_\\_\\_ Sleeve lobectomy \n              \\_\\_\\_ Bilobectomy \n              \\_\\_\\_ Pneumonectomy \n              \\_\\_\\_ Major airway resection (specify): \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n              \\_\\_\\_ Adjacent structures (specify): \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n              \\_\\_\\_ Other (specify): \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n              \\_\\_\\_ Not specified \n\n              **Specimen Laterality **\n              \\_\\_\\_ Right \n              \\_\\_\\_ Left \n              \\_\\_\\_ Not specified \n\n              **TUMOR **\n\n              **Tumor Focality (Note [A](#bookmark=id.d93muik2eubw))**\n              \\_\\_\\_ Single focus \n              \\_\\_\\_ Separate tumor nodules (metastases) in same lobe (pT3) \n              **\\+Number of Intrapulmonary Metastases: \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_**\n              \\_\\_\\_ Separate tumor nodules (metastases) in different ipsilateral lobe (pT4) \n              **\\+Number of Intrapulmonary Metastases: \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_**\n              \\_\\_\\_ Separate tumor nodule(s) (metastases) in a contralateral lobe (pM1a) \n              **\\+Number of Distant Metastases: \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_**\n              \\_\\_\\_ Multifocal tumor nodules of similar histology type not considered intrapulmonary metastases or too numerous for separate synoptic reports (e.g., multiple ground-glass / lepidic nodules or carcinoid tumors) (use m suffix) \n              **\\+Number of Tumor Nodules **\n              \\_\\_\\_ Specify number: \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n              \\_\\_\\_ Other (specify): \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n              \\_\\_\\_ Cannot be determined: \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n              \\_\\_\\_ Pneumonic-type adenocarcinoma \n              \\_\\_\\_ Cannot be determined \n\n              **Tumor Site (select all that apply)**\n              \\_\\_\\_ Upper lobe of lung: \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n              \\_\\_\\_ Middle lobe of lung: \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n              \\_\\_\\_ Lower lobe of lung: \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n              \\_\\_\\_ Bronchus, main: \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n              \\_\\_\\_ Bronchus intermedius: \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n              \\_\\_\\_ Bronchus, lobar (specify): \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n              \\_\\_\\_ Other (specify): \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n              \\_\\_\\_ Not specified \n\n              **Tumor Size (Note [B](#bookmark=id.5q8pnuf1bwbf))**\n              **Invasive Tumor Size\\# **\n              *\\# Invasive tumor size equals total tumor size for all tumor types other than invasive non-mucinous*\n              *adenocarcinoma with lepidic component.

Tumor Focality**\n              When more than one tumor nodule is identified in resection specimens, it is important to attempt distinction of synchronous primary tumors from a tumor with intrapulmonary metastasis. These scenarios have different prognoses and are staged differently. Multiple tumor nodules of different histologic types (e.g., one squamous cell carcinoma and one adenocarcinoma) are considered synchronous primaries and should be recorded as such in the pathology report with an individual TNM category assigned to each tumor.[1](#bookmark=id.djkxfss33lzh) In such cases, required reporting elements should be recorded for each primary tumor, and this is most easily achieved by issuing two synoptic reports (one for each of the cancers). For lung adenocarcinomas, comprehensive histologic assessment has been proposed for the distinction of synchronous primaries from separate tumor nodules (intrapulmonary metastasis).[2](#bookmark=id.hpa4f5a60o4w) Other pathologic criteria for distinguishing synchronous primary lung adenocarcinomas from separate tumor nodules (intrapulmonary metastasis) that are not based strictly on histologic assessment (e.g., assessing similarity of breakpoints using comparative genomic hybridization) are detailed in the 8th edition of the AJCC staging manual.[3](#bookmark=id.fw8za221gfe7)\n\n              Multifocal lung adenocarcinoma with lepidic features is the designation applied to multiple discrete foci of lepidic-predominant adenocarcinoma (LPA), minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA), or adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) with or without other subtypes of adenocarcinoma as lesser components that manifest on computed tomography (CT) as multiple subsolid (either pure ground glass or part solid) nodules.[4](#bookmark=id.bghnuxh0fgis) This designation applies whether a detailed histologic assessment shows a matching or different appearance among the tumor foci. Data suggest that in most cases, the multiple lesions represent synchronous primary tumors.[5](#bookmark=id.44vkxskw7et7) Assignment of T category in these cases is based on the highest T lesion, followed by the suffix “m”, indicating multiplicity, or the number of tumors in parentheses (e.g., T1b(m) or T1b(2)) (Table 1).[3](#bookmark=id.fw8za221gfe7) It should be noted that foci of atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH) are not counted for the purpose of TNM classification.\n\n              In some patients, adenocarcinoma manifests radiographically as diffuse consolidation, which has been designated as “pneumonic-type” lung adenocarcinoma. Such imaging findings typically correspond pathologically to invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma, but mixed mucinous and non-mucinous patterns may also be seen.[5](#bookmark=id.44vkxskw7et7) Invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma often exhibits lepidic-predominant growth, but robust sampling usually discloses invasive foci. Occasionally, invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma shows a heterogeneous mixture of other growth patterns. To qualify as pneumonic-type adenocarcinoma, tumor should be diffusely distributed throughout a region(s) of lung, as opposed to forming discrete single or multiple well-demarcated nodules or masses.[5](#bookmark=id.44vkxskw7et7)\n\n              The size of diffuse pneumonic-type adenocarcinomas, as well as miliary forms of adenocarcinoma, is often difficult to measure. When a single tumor area is present, it is categorized according to standard TNM criteria. Multiple tumor areas are categorized according to the extent of lobar involvement: T3 when limited to a single lobe, T4 when there is involvement of other ipsilateral lobe, and M1a is used to indicate the presence of contralateral lung involvement.[3](#bookmark=id.fw8za221gfe7)\n\n              In the setting of multiple lung cancers other than adenocarcinoma, pathologists may use the suffix m for multiple tumors of same histology as long as those tumors are not better considered intrapulmonary metastases. In this situation, AJCC suggests assigning the T category based on the size of the largest tumor nodule and using the m suffix to indicate an increased tumor burden.\n\n              **Table 1\\.

Tumor Size**\n              Based on data showing prognosis correlates with invasive size in non-mucinous adenocarcinomas with lepidic and invasive components, the AJCC has adopted a rule that for non-mucinous adenocarcinomas with a lepidic component, only the size of the invasive component is used to assign T category.[1,](#bookmark=id.k7bnuns2qeb3)[2,](#bookmark=id.fqpk04orkcat)[3,](#bookmark=id.uevotd6f7qvq)[4,](#bookmark=id.tivn27vedf9j)[5](#bookmark=id.c99jorfxwu4l) This rule aligns with the recommendation previously set forth by the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) of using invasive size for T descriptor size.[6](#bookmark=id.aqnbsyp8jzs3) This rule does not apply to other histologic types of lung cancer, including invasive mucinous lung adenocarcinoma. Data available to establish Version 9 TNM categories were insufficient to analyze the eighth-edition proposal to distinguish invasive from non-invasive tumor size in part-solid and part-lepidic non-mucinous lung adenocarcinomas. Therefore, reporting both invasive size and total tumor size of these tumors remains important for validation of this concept.[2](#bookmark=id.fqpk04orkcat)\n\n              The invasive component to be measured in non-mucinous adenocarcinomas with a lepidic component includes any histologic subtype other than a lepidic pattern (i.e., acinar, papillary, micropapillary, and/or solid) and/or tumor cells infiltrating myofibroblastic stroma.[7](#bookmark=id.nw1mre1zfy3u) In tumors where the invasive component is not a single discrete measurable focus, estimating the percentage of the total tumor that is invasive and then multiplying by the total tumor size to estimate invasive tumor size is recommended.[7](#bookmark=id.nw1mre1zfy3u)\n\n\n              **C. Histologic Type**\n              For consistency in reporting, the histologic classification published by the World Health Organization (WHO) for tumors of the lung, including carcinoids, is recommended.[1](#bookmark=id.j12f738zwp1d) Although acceptable in small biopsies, a designation of non-small cell lung carcinoma is not acceptable in resection specimens.\n\n              Lung carcinomas should be adequately sampled in order to ensure defining features are satisfactorily represented in the sections examined histologically and the presence or absence of invasion can be thoroughly assessed. The WHO defines invasion in adenocarcinoma as: (1) any histologic subtype other than a lepidic pattern (i.e., acinar, papillary, micropapillary, and/or solid), (2) tumor cells infiltrating myofibroblastic stroma, (3) vascular or pleural invasion, or (4) spread through air spaces (STAS).[1](#bookmark=id.j12f738zwp1d)\n\n              STAS is defined as micropapillary clusters, solid nests or single cells of tumor extending beyond the edge of the tumor into the air spaces of the surrounding lung parenchyma. Studies and meta-analyses have shown STAS to be an independent prognostic factor in the major histologic types of lung cancer and increased incidence of recurrence in tumors that have undergone limited resection (e.g., segmentectomy, wedge resection).[1,](#bookmark=id.j12f738zwp1d)[2](#bookmark=id.o5rc4mootlu2) STAS should not be incorporated into the measurement of tumor size.\n\n              For cases in which a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) or minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA) is being considered, the lesion must be entirely submitted for histopathologic examination. A diagnosis of MIA is applied to a lepidic-predominant tumor ≤3 cm in size with an invasive component measuring ≤0.5 cm provided it does not exhibit any of the following: (1) tumor invades lymphatics, blood vessels or pleura, (2) tumor necrosis is present, (3) STAS is present.[1](#bookmark=id.j12f738zwp1d) Tumors ≤3 cm with ≤0.5 cm of invasion exhibiting 1 or more of these exclusionary features are classified as lepidic-predominant adenocarcinoma. A diagnosis of AIS or MIA should only be made on solitary lesions ≤3 cm in diameter. Specimens showing only AIS are categorized as Tis (AIS). MIA is classified as T1mi.[3](#bookmark=id.b6jst9kig3s1)\n\n              For the uncommon occurrence of a lepidic-predominant tumor \\&gt;3.0 cm with either no invasion or ≤0.5 cm of invasion, it is recommended that such tumors be classified as lepidic-predominant adenocarcinoma and categorized as pT1a, as there is insufficient data to conclude they have the same prognostic features as ≤3.0 cm tumors meeting criteria for AIS or MIA.[3](#bookmark=id.b6jst9kig3s1)\n\n              Classification of adenocarcinomas by predominant histologic pattern can be useful for assessing pathologic grade and distinguishing separate independent tumors from intrapulmonary metastases. The WHO recommends classifying invasive non-mucinous adenocarcinomas according to the predominant subtype and specifying non-predominant subtypes semi-quantitatively in 5% increments.[1](#bookmark=id.j12f738zwp1d) In poorly differentiated cases, immunohistochemistry can greatly aid in classification. This is particularly useful in making a diagnosis of solid-type adenocarcinoma or nonkeratinizing squamous cell carcinoma.\n\n\n              **D. Histopathologic Grade**\n              The predominant histological pattern of non-mucinous adenocarcinomas is associated with prognosis with lepidic-predominant tumors having the best prognosis, acinar and papillary-predominant tumors having an intermediate prognosis, and solid-predominant and micropapillary-predominant tumors having the worst prognosis.[1](#bookmark=id.v6vsjosqfx6u) A recent study by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) Pathology Committee found that a combination of predominant and worst histological pattern improves prediction of patient outcome.[1](#bookmark=id.v6vsjosqfx6u) The following grading scheme was recommended for resected early-stage non-mucinous lung adenocarcinoma.\n\n              IASLC Histopathologic Grading Scheme for Non-mucinous Lung Adenocarcinoma:\n\n              Grade 1 (G1):  Well-differentiated (lepidic-predominant with no or \\&lt; 20% high-grade pattern)\n              Grade 2 (G2):  Moderately differentiated (acinar or papillary-predominant with no or \\&lt; 20% high-grade\n                                   pattern)\n              Grade 3 (G3):  Poorly differentiated (any tumor with ≥ 20% high-grade pattern (i.e., solid, micropapillary,\n                                   cribriform, or complex glandular pattern).\n\n              Note: A complex glandular pattern is defined by fused glands or single cells infiltrating in a desmoplastic stroma.\n\n              Neuroendocrine tumors continue to be classified based on their diagnostic criteria as low-grade (typical carcinoid/neuroendocrine tumor, grade 1), intermediate-grade (atypical carcinoid/neuroendocrine tumor, grade 2\\) and neuroendocrine carcinoma (large cell carcinoma and small cell carcinoma).[2](#bookmark=id.tmze642qthmg)\n\n              Use of the above grading schemes is required for non-mucinous adenocarcinomas and neuroendocrine tumors. There is currently no established grading scheme for invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the lung.[2](#bookmark=id.tmze642qthmg)\n\n              For other tumors, the four-tiered grading scheme for lung cancer (shown below) has been put forth by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) may be used.[1,](#bookmark=id.v6vsjosqfx6u)[3](#bookmark=id.wbk3tbqedobw)\n\n              AJCC Histopathologic Grading Scheme:[3](#bookmark=id.wbk3tbqedobw)\n              Grade X (GX): Cannot be assessed\n              Grade 1 (G1):  Well-differentiated\n              Grade 2 (G2):  Moderately differentiated\n              Grade 3 (G3):  Poorly differentiated\n              Grade 4 (G4):  Undifferentiated\n\n\n              **E. Visceral Pleural Invasion**\n              The presence of visceral pleural invasion by tumors ≤ 3 cm changes the T category from pT1 to pT2a.[1](#bookmark=id.qtmxupheceeg) Studies have shown that tumors ≤ 3 cm that penetrate beyond the elastic layer of the visceral pleura behave similarly to similar-size tumors that extend to the visceral pleural surface.[2,](#bookmark=id.jm0n1e8zhkjo)[3](#bookmark=id.349xixxbtlw5) Visceral pleural invasion should therefore be considered present not only in tumors that extend to the visceral pleural surface, but also in tumors that penetrate beyond the elastic layer of the visceral pleura (Figure 1).[4,](#bookmark=id.bfvqnlba1vvn)[5,](#bookmark=id.nvhgsjkrijq1)[6](#bookmark=id.95o0d5kinqgf) To qualify for visceral pleural invasion, tumor cells must have crossed the thickest visceral pleural elastic layer, which is usually the outermost (external) elastic layer in the visceral pleura (the layer closest to the visceral pleural mesothelial-lined surface). In many patients, a thinner, sometimes discontinuous, elastic layer (internal visceral pleural elastic layer) can be appreciated closer to the lung parenchyma. Penetration of tumor through this thinner, variably discontinuous internal (i.e., closer to the lung parenchyma)) elastic layer does not qualify as visceral pleura invasion.[7](#bookmark=id.3y6m8ul4y515) The pleural elastic layers can be difficult to appreciate in hematoxylin-eosin stains. Elastic stains may facilitate the assessment of visceral pleural invasion.[2,](#bookmark=id.jm0n1e8zhkjo)[3,](#bookmark=id.349xixxbtlw5)[7](#bookmark=id.3y6m8ul4y515)\n\n              ![A collage of images of cellsDescription automatically generated][image1]\n              **Figure 1**. Types of visceral pleural invasion. Staining for elastin (e.g., elastic-Van Gieson \\[EVG\\] stain) can aid in detection of visceral pleural invasion where it is indeterminate by hematoxylin-eosin (H\\&E) stain. A and B. Visceral pleural invasion is present when a tumor penetrates beyond the thick (external) elastic layer of the visceral pleura (type PL1 pleural invasion) C. Tumor extension to the visceral pleural surface is also categorized as visceral pleural invasion (type PL2). Both types of visceral pleural invasion raise the T category of otherwise T1 tumors to T2a. D. Visceral pleural invasion is categorized as absent in tumors that do not penetrate the visceral pleural elastic layer (type PL0). (Original magnifications x200 \\[A\\], x400 \\[B and C\\], x600 \\[D\\]).\n\n              Based on available data, a tumor with direct invasion across a fissure or directly if the fissure is incomplete into an adjacent ipsilateral lobe should be classified as T2a unless the size of the tumor or other criteria that would dictate a higher T category are met.[7](#bookmark=id.3y6m8ul4y515)\n\n              Pleural tumor nodules, including same lobe visceral pleural nodules, separate from the primary tumor (non-contiguous) should be categorized as M1a.[1](#bookmark=id.qtmxupheceeg)\n\n\n              **F. Direct Invasion of Other Structures**\n              Lung tumors sometimes exhibit direct invasion of structures surrounding the lung parenchyma in which the arise. Direct hilar fat/soft tissue invasion without evidence of direct extension into other structures that would meet a higher T designation is categorized as T2a.[1](#bookmark=id.qnlgwqxlx9p0) Occasionally, lung cancer specimens consist of en bloc resections that incorporate extrapulmonary structures directly invaded by tumor. Accurate assessment of such specimens might require carefully study of the operative note and preoperative imaging, or communication with the surgeon regarding the nature and location of any attached extrapulmonary structures.\n\n              According to the AJCC, direct invasion of the parietal pleura is categorized as T3, as is direct invasion of the chest wall (including the superior sulcus).[1](#bookmark=id.qnlgwqxlx9p0) Although parietal pleural invasion appears to portend a worse prognosis within the pT3 category than an intralobar metastasis, evidence was insufficient to classify it as pT4 in Version 9 of the TNM Classification for Lung Cancer.[1](#bookmark=id.qnlgwqxlx9p0) Specifying the chest wall structures directly invaded by tumor (e.g., intercostal muscle\\[s\\], rib\\[s\\], pectoralis muscle, latissimus muscle, serratus muscle) can facilitate patient management. Direct phrenic nerve and parietal pericardial invasion are also categorized as T3. Tumor extension into the visceral pericardium (epicardium) is categorized as T4.\n\n              Direct invasion of central thoracic structures, including the heart, great vessels, mediastinum, trachea, recurrent laryngeal nerve, esophagus, vertebral body, and carina is considered T4. Direct invasion of the diaphragm is also categorized as T4.\n\n              References\n\n              1. Van Schil PE, Asamura H, Nishimura KK, et al.

Treatment Effect**\n              For patients who have received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, immunotherapy and/or radiation therapy before surgical resection, quantifying the extent of therapy-induced tumor regression provides prognostically relevant information.[1,](#bookmark=id.u2ohybp1xhq)[2](#bookmark=id.382e1h5dpjbm) Measuring residual tumor size in patients with a partial response can be challenging, as there are often discontinuous clusters of viable tumor at the peripheral edges of an irregular area of treatment-related necrosis. The IASLC recently published multidisciplinary recommendations for the pathologic assessment of lung cancer resection specimens after neoadjuvant therapy.[2](#bookmark=id.382e1h5dpjbm) To evaluate treatment effect, the resection specimen should be sectioned in the plane that shows the maximum dimension of the tumor bed and its relationship to structures relevant for determining pT category and margin status. Three-dimensional size of the tumor bed and an estimated percentage of gross necrosis should be recorded. Tumor beds up to 3.0 cm may be submitted entirely for microscopic examination. For larger tumors, the IASLC recommends complete sampling of an entire cross-section of tumor bed with mapping of each section to a gross photograph. The percentages of viable tumor, stromal tissue (i.e., fibrosis and inflammation) and necrosis (in increments of 10% totaling 100%) should be determined based on review of all microscopic sections of tumor bed. If a component amounts to less than 5%, an estimate of single percentages should be recorded. This approach to evaluating residual tumor refines that suggested by the AJCC of multiplying the percentage of the mass that is composed of viable tumor by the size of the total mass to estimate post-neoadjuvant tumor size.[3](#bookmark=id.ontpdtg3iv2v) A “y” prefix is applied to the TNM classification in resections following multimodality therapy (see Note J). If no viable tumor is identified on resection, ypT0 is the appropriate designation.\n\n\n              **H. Lymphatic and/or Vascular Invasion**\n              There are data showing lymphatic invasion by tumor represents an unfavorable prognostic finding, but studies on the role of large vessel invasion have produced somewhat conflicting results.[1,](#bookmark=id.n9stziwou80k)[2](#bookmark=id.s8a25xnafg55) The presence of lymphovascular invasion is exclusionary of adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) and minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA).[3](#bookmark=id.xboycpaa5x9) Angiolymphatic invasion does not alter the pT and pN classifications or the TNM stage grouping.\n\n\n              **I. Margins**\n              Surgical margins represent sites that have either been cut or bluntly dissected by the surgeon to resect the specimen. The presence of tumor at a surgical margin is an important finding, because there is the potential for residual tumor remaining in the patient in the area surrounding a positive margin. Peripheral wedge resections contain a parenchymal margin, which is represented by the tissue at the staple line(s). Lobectomy and pneumonectomy specimens contain bronchial and vascular margins and, depending on the completeness of the interlobar fissures and other anatomic factors, may also contain parenchymal margins in the form of staple lines. En bloc resections that contain extrapulmonary structures as part of the specimen have additional margins (e.g., parietal pleura, chest wall), which should be designated by the surgeon for appropriate handling. Note that the visceral pleura is not a surgical margin.\n\n              **J. pTNM Classification**\n              The TNM staging system of the AJCC and the UICC is recommended for both non-small cell lung cancer and small cell lung cancer.[1](#bookmark=id.bapzlatzwsu0) Typical carcinoid and atypical carcinoid tumors should also be classified according to the TNM staging system.\n\n              By AJCC/UICC convention, the designation “T” refers to a primary tumor that has not been previously treated. The symbol “p” refers to the pathologic classification of the TNM, as opposed to the clinical classification, and is based clinical stage information modified/refined by operative findings and pathological evaluation of the resected specimen. The pTNM classification is applicable when surgery is performed before adjuvant systemic or radiation therapy is initiated. pT entails a resection of the primary tumor or biopsy adequate to evaluate the highest pT category, pN entails removal of nodes adequate to validate lymph node metastasis, and pM implies microscopic examination of distant lesions.\n\n              **TNM Descriptors**\n              For identification of special cases of TNM or pTNM classifications, the “m” suffix and “y,” and “r” prefixes are used. Although they do not affect the stage grouping, they indicate cases needing separate analysis.\n\n              The “m” suffix can indicate the presence of multiple ground-glass/lepidic adenocarcinomas or be used to indicate increased tumor burden of multifocal tumors of same histologic type that are too numerous for individual separate synoptic reports. It is recorded in parentheses: pT(m) (see Note A).\n\n              The “y” prefix indicates those cases in which classification is performed during or following initial multimodality therapy (i.e., neoadjuvant chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or both chemotherapy and radiation therapy). The cTNM or pTNM category is identified by a “y” prefix. The ycTNM or ypTNM categorizes the extent of tumor actually present at the time of that examination. The “y” categorization is not an estimate of tumor prior to multimodality therapy (i.e., before initiation of neoadjuvant therapy) (see Note G).\n\n              The “r” prefix indicates a recurrent tumor when staged after a documented disease-free interval and is identified by the “r” prefix: rTNM.\n\n              **T Category Considerations**\n              Version 9 of the TNM classification for lung cancer maintains the eighth-edition T descriptors.[2](#bookmark=id.x3iq3zkezhjf)\n\n              Although obstructive pneumonitis associated with tumor is sometimes seen histologically, accurate assessment of tumor-associated obstructive pneumonitis as well as atelectasis requires integration of clinical and radiographic information. Atelectasis and obstructive pneumonitis recognized by pathology only should not be used for TNM staging.\n\n              **N Category Considerations**\n              Lymph node metastases are an adverse prognostic factor, the extent of which is dependent on the location and number of the involved lymph node stations.[3](#bookmark=id.5ocbd5ehsshi) The involved lymph node stations should be recorded according to the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) lymph node map. Given the nature of the procedure, lymph nodes obtained by mediastinoscopy are often received fragmented, and it may not be possible to distinguish a single fragmented lymph node from fragments of multiple lymph nodes. For this reason, only if the actual number of nodes is known or provided should it be quantified. Otherwise, it is permissible to report the sites of nodal metastases without specifying the number involved.\n\n              Although extranodal extension of a positive mediastinal lymph node may represent an unfavorable prognostic finding, it does not change the pN classification or the TNM stage grouping. Extranodal extension refers to the extension of metastatic intranodal tumor beyond the lymph node capsule into the surrounding tissue. Direct extension of a primary tumor into a nearby lymph node does not qualify as extranodal extension.\n\n              The anatomic classification of regional lymph nodes proposed by the IASLC is shown below. A complete description of the anatomic limits of each nodal station can be found in the AJCC Staging Manual.[1](#bookmark=id.bapzlatzwsu0)\n\n              Station 1    Lower cervical, supraclavicular, and sternal notch nodes\n              Station 2    Upper paratracheal nodes\n              Station 3    Prevascular and retrotracheal nodes\n              Station 4    Lower paratracheal nodes\n              Station 5    Subaortic nodes (aorto-pulmonary window)\n              Station 6    Paraaortic nodes (ascending aorta or phrenic)\n              Station 7    Subcarinal nodes\n              Station 8    Paraesophageal nodes (below carina)\n              Station 9    Pulmonary ligament nodes\n              Station 10  Hilar nodes\n              Station 11   Interlobar nodes\n              Station 12   Lobar nodes\n              Station 13   Segmental nodes\n              Station 14   Subsegmental nodes\n\n              Metastasis to nonregional lymph nodes (i.e., lymph nodes that are not included in the IASLC lymph node map) are assigned to the M1b or M1c category depending or whether single or multiple metastases are present.\n\n              **M Category Considerations**\n              With respect to this protocol, reporting a pM designation is required only if metastasis is pathologically confirmed in the specimen(s) being examined. The designation pMX should not be used.\n\n              In addition to malignant pleural effusion, malignant pericardial effusion, as well as separate tumor nodule(s) in a contralateral lobe are categorized as M1a.[4](#bookmark=id.3is2d4k3wdks) Visceral or parietal ipsilateral pleural tumor nodules and pericardial tumor nodules that are not in direct continuity with the primary lung tumor are also categorized as M1a. A single extrathoracic metastasis in a single organ system is categorized as M1b. Multiple extrathoracic metastases are categorized as M1c1 when they occur in a single organ system and M1c2 when they occur in multiple organ systems.\n\n\n       Context: {context}\n\n       Question: {question}\n\n       Do not include any explanations, introductory text, or Markdown code formatting.

Tumor Focality**\n              When more than one tumor nodule is identified in resection specimens, it is important to attempt distinction of synchronous primary tumors from a tumor with intrapulmonary metastasis. These scenarios have different prognoses and are staged differently. Multiple tumor nodules of different histologic types (e.g., one squamous cell carcinoma and one adenocarcinoma) are considered synchronous primaries and should be recorded as such in the pathology report with an individual TNM category assigned to each tumor.[1](#bookmark=id.djkxfss33lzh) In such cases, required reporting elements should be recorded for each primary tumor, and this is most easily achieved by issuing two synoptic reports (one for each of the cancers). For lung adenocarcinomas, comprehensive histologic assessment has been proposed for the distinction of synchronous primaries from separate tumor nodules (intrapulmonary metastasis).[2](#bookmark=id.hpa4f5a60o4w) Other pathologic criteria for distinguishing synchronous primary lung adenocarcinomas from separate tumor nodules (intrapulmonary metastasis) that are not based strictly on histologic assessment (e.g., assessing similarity of breakpoints using comparative genomic hybridization) are detailed in the 8th edition of the AJCC staging manual.[3](#bookmark=id.fw8za221gfe7)\n\n              Multifocal lung adenocarcinoma with lepidic features is the designation applied to multiple discrete foci of lepidic-predominant adenocarcinoma (LPA), minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA), or adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) with or without other subtypes of adenocarcinoma as lesser components that manifest on computed tomography (CT) as multiple subsolid (either pure ground glass or part solid) nodules.[4](#bookmark=id.bghnuxh0fgis) This designation applies whether a detailed histologic assessment shows a matching or different appearance among the tumor foci. Data suggest that in most cases, the multiple lesions represent synchronous primary tumors.[5](#bookmark=id.44vkxskw7et7) Assignment of T category in these cases is based on the highest T lesion, followed by the suffix “m”, indicating multiplicity, or the number of tumors in parentheses (e.g., T1b(m) or T1b(2)) (Table 1).[3](#bookmark=id.fw8za221gfe7) It should be noted that foci of atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH) are not counted for the purpose of TNM classification.\n\n              In some patients, adenocarcinoma manifests radiographically as diffuse consolidation, which has been designated as “pneumonic-type” lung adenocarcinoma. Such imaging findings typically correspond pathologically to invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma, but mixed mucinous and non-mucinous patterns may also be seen.[5](#bookmark=id.44vkxskw7et7) Invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma often exhibits lepidic-predominant growth, but robust sampling usually discloses invasive foci. Occasionally, invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma shows a heterogeneous mixture of other growth patterns. To qualify as pneumonic-type adenocarcinoma, tumor should be diffusely distributed throughout a region(s) of lung, as opposed to forming discrete single or multiple well-demarcated nodules or masses.[5](#bookmark=id.44vkxskw7et7)\n\n              The size of diffuse pneumonic-type adenocarcinomas, as well as miliary forms of adenocarcinoma, is often difficult to measure. When a single tumor area is present, it is categorized according to standard TNM criteria. Multiple tumor areas are categorized according to the extent of lobar involvement: T3 when limited to a single lobe, T4 when there is involvement of other ipsilateral lobe, and M1a is used to indicate the presence of contralateral lung involvement.[3](#bookmark=id.fw8za221gfe7)\n\n              In the setting of multiple lung cancers other than adenocarcinoma, pathologists may use the suffix m for multiple tumors of same histology as long as those tumors are not better considered intrapulmonary metastases. In this situation, AJCC suggests assigning the T category based on the size of the largest tumor nodule and using the m suffix to indicate an increased tumor burden.\n\n              **Table 1\\.

Tumor Size**\n              Based on data showing prognosis correlates with invasive size in non-mucinous adenocarcinomas with lepidic and invasive components, the AJCC has adopted a rule that for non-mucinous adenocarcinomas with a lepidic component, only the size of the invasive component is used to assign T category.[1,](#bookmark=id.k7bnuns2qeb3)[2,](#bookmark=id.fqpk04orkcat)[3,](#bookmark=id.uevotd6f7qvq)[4,](#bookmark=id.tivn27vedf9j)[5](#bookmark=id.c99jorfxwu4l) This rule aligns with the recommendation previously set forth by the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) of using invasive size for T descriptor size.[6](#bookmark=id.aqnbsyp8jzs3) This rule does not apply to other histologic types of lung cancer, including invasive mucinous lung adenocarcinoma. Data available to establish Version 9 TNM categories were insufficient to analyze the eighth-edition proposal to distinguish invasive from non-invasive tumor size in part-solid and part-lepidic non-mucinous lung adenocarcinomas. Therefore, reporting both invasive size and total tumor size of these tumors remains important for validation of this concept.[2](#bookmark=id.fqpk04orkcat)\n\n              The invasive component to be measured in non-mucinous adenocarcinomas with a lepidic component includes any histologic subtype other than a lepidic pattern (i.e., acinar, papillary, micropapillary, and/or solid) and/or tumor cells infiltrating myofibroblastic stroma.[7](#bookmark=id.nw1mre1zfy3u) In tumors where the invasive component is not a single discrete measurable focus, estimating the percentage of the total tumor that is invasive and then multiplying by the total tumor size to estimate invasive tumor size is recommended.[7](#bookmark=id.nw1mre1zfy3u)\n\n\n              **C. Histologic Type**\n              For consistency in reporting, the histologic classification published by the World Health Organization (WHO) for tumors of the lung, including carcinoids, is recommended.[1](#bookmark=id.j12f738zwp1d) Although acceptable in small biopsies, a designation of non-small cell lung carcinoma is not acceptable in resection specimens.\n\n              Lung carcinomas should be adequately sampled in order to ensure defining features are satisfactorily represented in the sections examined histologically and the presence or absence of invasion can be thoroughly assessed. The WHO defines invasion in adenocarcinoma as: (1) any histologic subtype other than a lepidic pattern (i.e., acinar, papillary, micropapillary, and/or solid), (2) tumor cells infiltrating myofibroblastic stroma, (3) vascular or pleural invasion, or (4) spread through air spaces (STAS).[1](#bookmark=id.j12f738zwp1d)\n\n              STAS is defined as micropapillary clusters, solid nests or single cells of tumor extending beyond the edge of the tumor into the air spaces of the surrounding lung parenchyma. Studies and meta-analyses have shown STAS to be an independent prognostic factor in the major histologic types of lung cancer and increased incidence of recurrence in tumors that have undergone limited resection (e.g., segmentectomy, wedge resection).[1,](#bookmark=id.j12f738zwp1d)[2](#bookmark=id.o5rc4mootlu2) STAS should not be incorporated into the measurement of tumor size.\n\n              For cases in which a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) or minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA) is being considered, the lesion must be entirely submitted for histopathologic examination. A diagnosis of MIA is applied to a lepidic-predominant tumor ≤3 cm in size with an invasive component measuring ≤0.5 cm provided it does not exhibit any of the following: (1) tumor invades lymphatics, blood vessels or pleura, (2) tumor necrosis is present, (3) STAS is present.[1](#bookmark=id.j12f738zwp1d) Tumors ≤3 cm with ≤0.5 cm of invasion exhibiting 1 or more of these exclusionary features are classified as lepidic-predominant adenocarcinoma. A diagnosis of AIS or MIA should only be made on solitary lesions ≤3 cm in diameter. Specimens showing only AIS are categorized as Tis (AIS). MIA is classified as T1mi.[3](#bookmark=id.b6jst9kig3s1)\n\n              For the uncommon occurrence of a lepidic-predominant tumor \\&gt;3.0 cm with either no invasion or ≤0.5 cm of invasion, it is recommended that such tumors be classified as lepidic-predominant adenocarcinoma and categorized as pT1a, as there is insufficient data to conclude they have the same prognostic features as ≤3.0 cm tumors meeting criteria for AIS or MIA.[3](#bookmark=id.b6jst9kig3s1)\n\n              Classification of adenocarcinomas by predominant histologic pattern can be useful for assessing pathologic grade and distinguishing separate independent tumors from intrapulmonary metastases. The WHO recommends classifying invasive non-mucinous adenocarcinomas according to the predominant subtype and specifying non-predominant subtypes semi-quantitatively in 5% increments.[1](#bookmark=id.j12f738zwp1d) In poorly differentiated cases, immunohistochemistry can greatly aid in classification. This is particularly useful in making a diagnosis of solid-type adenocarcinoma or nonkeratinizing squamous cell carcinoma.\n\n\n              **D. Histopathologic Grade**\n              The predominant histological pattern of non-mucinous adenocarcinomas is associated with prognosis with lepidic-predominant tumors having the best prognosis, acinar and papillary-predominant tumors having an intermediate prognosis, and solid-predominant and micropapillary-predominant tumors having the worst prognosis.[1](#bookmark=id.v6vsjosqfx6u) A recent study by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) Pathology Committee found that a combination of predominant and worst histological pattern improves prediction of patient outcome.[1](#bookmark=id.v6vsjosqfx6u) The following grading scheme was recommended for resected early-stage non-mucinous lung adenocarcinoma.\n\n              IASLC Histopathologic Grading Scheme for Non-mucinous Lung Adenocarcinoma:\n\n              Grade 1 (G1):  Well-differentiated (lepidic-predominant with no or \\&lt; 20% high-grade pattern)\n              Grade 2 (G2):  Moderately differentiated (acinar or papillary-predominant with no or \\&lt; 20% high-grade\n                                   pattern)\n              Grade 3 (G3):  Poorly differentiated (any tumor with ≥ 20% high-grade pattern (i.e., solid, micropapillary,\n                                   cribriform, or complex glandular pattern).\n\n              Note: A complex glandular pattern is defined by fused glands or single cells infiltrating in a desmoplastic stroma.\n\n              Neuroendocrine tumors continue to be classified based on their diagnostic criteria as low-grade (typical carcinoid/neuroendocrine tumor, grade 1), intermediate-grade (atypical carcinoid/neuroendocrine tumor, grade 2\\) and neuroendocrine carcinoma (large cell carcinoma and small cell carcinoma).[2](#bookmark=id.tmze642qthmg)\n\n              Use of the above grading schemes is required for non-mucinous adenocarcinomas and neuroendocrine tumors. There is currently no established grading scheme for invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the lung.[2](#bookmark=id.tmze642qthmg)\n\n              For other tumors, the four-tiered grading scheme for lung cancer (shown below) has been put forth by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) may be used.[1,](#bookmark=id.v6vsjosqfx6u)[3](#bookmark=id.wbk3tbqedobw)\n\n              AJCC Histopathologic Grading Scheme:[3](#bookmark=id.wbk3tbqedobw)\n              Grade X (GX): Cannot be assessed\n              Grade 1 (G1):  Well-differentiated\n              Grade 2 (G2):  Moderately differentiated\n              Grade 3 (G3):  Poorly differentiated\n              Grade 4 (G4):  Undifferentiated\n\n\n              **E. Visceral Pleural Invasion**\n              The presence of visceral pleural invasion by tumors ≤ 3 cm changes the T category from pT1 to pT2a.[1](#bookmark=id.qtmxupheceeg) Studies have shown that tumors ≤ 3 cm that penetrate beyond the elastic layer of the visceral pleura behave similarly to similar-size tumors that extend to the visceral pleural surface.[2,](#bookmark=id.jm0n1e8zhkjo)[3](#bookmark=id.349xixxbtlw5) Visceral pleural invasion should therefore be considered present not only in tumors that extend to the visceral pleural surface, but also in tumors that penetrate beyond the elastic layer of the visceral pleura (Figure 1).[4,](#bookmark=id.bfvqnlba1vvn)[5,](#bookmark=id.nvhgsjkrijq1)[6](#bookmark=id.95o0d5kinqgf) To qualify for visceral pleural invasion, tumor cells must have crossed the thickest visceral pleural elastic layer, which is usually the outermost (external) elastic layer in the visceral pleura (the layer closest to the visceral pleural mesothelial-lined surface). In many patients, a thinner, sometimes discontinuous, elastic layer (internal visceral pleural elastic layer) can be appreciated closer to the lung parenchyma. Penetration of tumor through this thinner, variably discontinuous internal (i.e., closer to the lung parenchyma)) elastic layer does not qualify as visceral pleura invasion.[7](#bookmark=id.3y6m8ul4y515) The pleural elastic layers can be difficult to appreciate in hematoxylin-eosin stains. Elastic stains may facilitate the assessment of visceral pleural invasion.[2,](#bookmark=id.jm0n1e8zhkjo)[3,](#bookmark=id.349xixxbtlw5)[7](#bookmark=id.3y6m8ul4y515)\n\n              ![A collage of images of cellsDescription automatically generated][image1]\n              **Figure 1**. Types of visceral pleural invasion. Staining for elastin (e.g., elastic-Van Gieson \\[EVG\\] stain) can aid in detection of visceral pleural invasion where it is indeterminate by hematoxylin-eosin (H\\&E) stain. A and B. Visceral pleural invasion is present when a tumor penetrates beyond the thick (external) elastic layer of the visceral pleura (type PL1 pleural invasion) C. Tumor extension to the visceral pleural surface is also categorized as visceral pleural invasion (type PL2). Both types of visceral pleural invasion raise the T category of otherwise T1 tumors to T2a. D. Visceral pleural invasion is categorized as absent in tumors that do not penetrate the visceral pleural elastic layer (type PL0). (Original magnifications x200 \\[A\\], x400 \\[B and C\\], x600 \\[D\\]).\n\n              Based on available data, a tumor with direct invasion across a fissure or directly if the fissure is incomplete into an adjacent ipsilateral lobe should be classified as T2a unless the size of the tumor or other criteria that would dictate a higher T category are met.[7](#bookmark=id.3y6m8ul4y515)\n\n              Pleural tumor nodules, including same lobe visceral pleural nodules, separate from the primary tumor (non-contiguous) should be categorized as M1a.[1](#bookmark=id.qtmxupheceeg)\n\n\n              **F. Direct Invasion of Other Structures**\n              Lung tumors sometimes exhibit direct invasion of structures surrounding the lung parenchyma in which the arise. Direct hilar fat/soft tissue invasion without evidence of direct extension into other structures that would meet a higher T designation is categorized as T2a.[1](#bookmark=id.qnlgwqxlx9p0) Occasionally, lung cancer specimens consist of en bloc resections that incorporate extrapulmonary structures directly invaded by tumor. Accurate assessment of such specimens might require carefully study of the operative note and preoperative imaging, or communication with the surgeon regarding the nature and location of any attached extrapulmonary structures.\n\n              According to the AJCC, direct invasion of the parietal pleura is categorized as T3, as is direct invasion of the chest wall (including the superior sulcus).[1](#bookmark=id.qnlgwqxlx9p0) Although parietal pleural invasion appears to portend a worse prognosis within the pT3 category than an intralobar metastasis, evidence was insufficient to classify it as pT4 in Version 9 of the TNM Classification for Lung Cancer.[1](#bookmark=id.qnlgwqxlx9p0) Specifying the chest wall structures directly invaded by tumor (e.g., intercostal muscle\\[s\\], rib\\[s\\], pectoralis muscle, latissimus muscle, serratus muscle) can facilitate patient management. Direct phrenic nerve and parietal pericardial invasion are also categorized as T3. Tumor extension into the visceral pericardium (epicardium) is categorized as T4.\n\n              Direct invasion of central thoracic structures, including the heart, great vessels, mediastinum, trachea, recurrent laryngeal nerve, esophagus, vertebral body, and carina is considered T4. Direct invasion of the diaphragm is also categorized as T4.\n\n              References\n\n              1. Van Schil PE, Asamura H, Nishimura KK, et al.

Treatment Effect**\n              For patients who have received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, immunotherapy and/or radiation therapy before surgical resection, quantifying the extent of therapy-induced tumor regression provides prognostically relevant information.[1,](#bookmark=id.u2ohybp1xhq)[2](#bookmark=id.382e1h5dpjbm) Measuring residual tumor size in patients with a partial response can be challenging, as there are often discontinuous clusters of viable tumor at the peripheral edges of an irregular area of treatment-related necrosis. The IASLC recently published multidisciplinary recommendations for the pathologic assessment of lung cancer resection specimens after neoadjuvant therapy.[2](#bookmark=id.382e1h5dpjbm) To evaluate treatment effect, the resection specimen should be sectioned in the plane that shows the maximum dimension of the tumor bed and its relationship to structures relevant for determining pT category and margin status. Three-dimensional size of the tumor bed and an estimated percentage of gross necrosis should be recorded. Tumor beds up to 3.0 cm may be submitted entirely for microscopic examination. For larger tumors, the IASLC recommends complete sampling of an entire cross-section of tumor bed with mapping of each section to a gross photograph. The percentages of viable tumor, stromal tissue (i.e., fibrosis and inflammation) and necrosis (in increments of 10% totaling 100%) should be determined based on review of all microscopic sections of tumor bed. If a component amounts to less than 5%, an estimate of single percentages should be recorded. This approach to evaluating residual tumor refines that suggested by the AJCC of multiplying the percentage of the mass that is composed of viable tumor by the size of the total mass to estimate post-neoadjuvant tumor size.[3](#bookmark=id.ontpdtg3iv2v) A “y” prefix is applied to the TNM classification in resections following multimodality therapy (see Note J). If no viable tumor is identified on resection, ypT0 is the appropriate designation.\n\n\n              **H. Lymphatic and/or Vascular Invasion**\n              There are data showing lymphatic invasion by tumor represents an unfavorable prognostic finding, but studies on the role of large vessel invasion have produced somewhat conflicting results.[1,](#bookmark=id.n9stziwou80k)[2](#bookmark=id.s8a25xnafg55) The presence of lymphovascular invasion is exclusionary of adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) and minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA).[3](#bookmark=id.xboycpaa5x9) Angiolymphatic invasion does not alter the pT and pN classifications or the TNM stage grouping.\n\n\n              **I. Margins**\n              Surgical margins represent sites that have either been cut or bluntly dissected by the surgeon to resect the specimen. The presence of tumor at a surgical margin is an important finding, because there is the potential for residual tumor remaining in the patient in the area surrounding a positive margin. Peripheral wedge resections contain a parenchymal margin, which is represented by the tissue at the staple line(s). Lobectomy and pneumonectomy specimens contain bronchial and vascular margins and, depending on the completeness of the interlobar fissures and other anatomic factors, may also contain parenchymal margins in the form of staple lines. En bloc resections that contain extrapulmonary structures as part of the specimen have additional margins (e.g., parietal pleura, chest wall), which should be designated by the surgeon for appropriate handling. Note that the visceral pleura is not a surgical margin.\n\n              **J. pTNM Classification**\n              The TNM staging system of the AJCC and the UICC is recommended for both non-small cell lung cancer and small cell lung cancer.[1](#bookmark=id.bapzlatzwsu0) Typical carcinoid and atypical carcinoid tumors should also be classified according to the TNM staging system.\n\n              By AJCC/UICC convention, the designation “T” refers to a primary tumor that has not been previously treated. The symbol “p” refers to the pathologic classification of the TNM, as opposed to the clinical classification, and is based clinical stage information modified/refined by operative findings and pathological evaluation of the resected specimen. The pTNM classification is applicable when surgery is performed before adjuvant systemic or radiation therapy is initiated. pT entails a resection of the primary tumor or biopsy adequate to evaluate the highest pT category, pN entails removal of nodes adequate to validate lymph node metastasis, and pM implies microscopic examination of distant lesions.\n\n              **TNM Descriptors**\n              For identification of special cases of TNM or pTNM classifications, the “m” suffix and “y,” and “r” prefixes are used. Although they do not affect the stage grouping, they indicate cases needing separate analysis.\n\n              The “m” suffix can indicate the presence of multiple ground-glass/lepidic adenocarcinomas or be used to indicate increased tumor burden of multifocal tumors of same histologic type that are too numerous for individual separate synoptic reports. It is recorded in parentheses: pT(m) (see Note A).\n\n              The “y” prefix indicates those cases in which classification is performed during or following initial multimodality therapy (i.e., neoadjuvant chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or both chemotherapy and radiation therapy). The cTNM or pTNM category is identified by a “y” prefix. The ycTNM or ypTNM categorizes the extent of tumor actually present at the time of that examination. The “y” categorization is not an estimate of tumor prior to multimodality therapy (i.e., before initiation of neoadjuvant therapy) (see Note G).\n\n              The “r” prefix indicates a recurrent tumor when staged after a documented disease-free interval and is identified by the “r” prefix: rTNM.\n\n              **T Category Considerations**\n              Version 9 of the TNM classification for lung cancer maintains the eighth-edition T descriptors.[2](#bookmark=id.x3iq3zkezhjf)\n\n              Although obstructive pneumonitis associated with tumor is sometimes seen histologically, accurate assessment of tumor-associated obstructive pneumonitis as well as atelectasis requires integration of clinical and radiographic information. Atelectasis and obstructive pneumonitis recognized by pathology only should not be used for TNM staging.\n\n              **N Category Considerations**\n              Lymph node metastases are an adverse prognostic factor, the extent of which is dependent on the location and number of the involved lymph node stations.[3](#bookmark=id.5ocbd5ehsshi) The involved lymph node stations should be recorded according to the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) lymph node map. Given the nature of the procedure, lymph nodes obtained by mediastinoscopy are often received fragmented, and it may not be possible to distinguish a single fragmented lymph node from fragments of multiple lymph nodes. For this reason, only if the actual number of nodes is known or provided should it be quantified. Otherwise, it is permissible to report the sites of nodal metastases without specifying the number involved.\n\n              Although extranodal extension of a positive mediastinal lymph node may represent an unfavorable prognostic finding, it does not change the pN classification or the TNM stage grouping. Extranodal extension refers to the extension of metastatic intranodal tumor beyond the lymph node capsule into the surrounding tissue. Direct extension of a primary tumor into a nearby lymph node does not qualify as extranodal extension.\n\n              The anatomic classification of regional lymph nodes proposed by the IASLC is shown below. A complete description of the anatomic limits of each nodal station can be found in the AJCC Staging Manual.[1](#bookmark=id.bapzlatzwsu0)\n\n              Station 1    Lower cervical, supraclavicular, and sternal notch nodes\n              Station 2    Upper paratracheal nodes\n              Station 3    Prevascular and retrotracheal nodes\n              Station 4    Lower paratracheal nodes\n              Station 5    Subaortic nodes (aorto-pulmonary window)\n              Station 6    Paraaortic nodes (ascending aorta or phrenic)\n              Station 7    Subcarinal nodes\n              Station 8    Paraesophageal nodes (below carina)\n              Station 9    Pulmonary ligament nodes\n              Station 10  Hilar nodes\n              Station 11   Interlobar nodes\n              Station 12   Lobar nodes\n              Station 13   Segmental nodes\n              Station 14   Subsegmental nodes\n\n              Metastasis to nonregional lymph nodes (i.e., lymph nodes that are not included in the IASLC lymph node map) are assigned to the M1b or M1c category depending or whether single or multiple metastases are present.\n\n              **M Category Considerations**\n              With respect to this protocol, reporting a pM designation is required only if metastasis is pathologically confirmed in the specimen(s) being examined. The designation pMX should not be used.\n\n              In addition to malignant pleural effusion, malignant pericardial effusion, as well as separate tumor nodule(s) in a contralateral lobe are categorized as M1a.[4](#bookmark=id.3is2d4k3wdks) Visceral or parietal ipsilateral pleural tumor nodules and pericardial tumor nodules that are not in direct continuity with the primary lung tumor are also categorized as M1a. A single extrathoracic metastasis in a single organ system is categorized as M1b. Multiple extrathoracic metastases are categorized as M1c1 when they occur in a single organ system and M1c2 when they occur in multiple organ systems.\n\n\n       Context: {context}\n\n       Question: {question}\n\n       Do not include any explanations, introductory text, or Markdown code formatting.

    "text": "OMOP-CDM\nThis document provides a comprehensive overview of the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM) tables available in the dataset. The OMOP-CDM is a standardized data model designed to facilitate the analysis and sharing of healthcare data across different institutions and studies. By using a common structure and terminology, the OMOP-CDM enables researchers to perform large-scale observational research and generate real-world evidence.\nIn this data dictionary, you will find detailed descriptions of each table and its columns, including data types, requirements, and any specific operations applied to the data. This information is crucial for understanding the structure and content of the dataset, ensuring accurate and meaningful analysis.\nVersion History: The data lake has evolved from OMOP CDM 5.3.1 (used in February-August 2025 releases) to OMOP CDM 5.4.2 (November 2025 release). The November 2025 upgrade includes new tables, enhanced field linking capabilities, updated naming conventions, and vocabulary modernization from January 2023 to August 2025. For detailed information about CDM changes, see the OHDSI CDM 5.4 Changes.\n\nOMOP CDM 5.4.2OMOP CDM 5.3.1\n\n\nThe following OMOP-CDM 5.4.2 tables are available in the November 2025 release:\n\n\n\n\nCategory\nTable Name\n\n\n\n\nClinical Data\ncondition_occurrence, drug_exposure, device_exposure, measurement, observation, procedure_occurrence, image_occurrence, visit_occurrence, visit_detail, note, death, specimen\n\n\nStandardized Derived Elements\nobservation_period, person\n\n\nVocabularies\nconcept, concept_ancestor, concept_class, concept_relationship, concept_synonym, domain, relationship, vocabulary, source_to_concept_map, cohort, cohort_definition\n\n\nHealth System Data\ncare_site, location, provider, cost\n\n\nDerived Elements\ncondition_era, drug_era, dose_era\n\n\nHealth Economics\npayer_plan_period\n\n\nMetadata\ncdm_source, metadata\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following OMOP-CDM 5.3.1 tables were available in the February, May, and August 2025 releases:\n\n\n\n\nCategory\nTable Name\n\n\n\n\nClinical Data\ncondition_occurrence, drug_exposure, device_exposure, measurement, observation, procedure_occurrence, image_occurrence, visit_occurrence, visit_detail, note, death, specimen\n\n\nStandardized Derived Elements\nobservation_period, person\n\n\nVocabularies\nconcept, concept_ancestor, concept_class, concept_relationship, concept_synonym, domain, relationship, vocabulary, source_to_concept_map, cohort_definition\n\n\nHealth System Data\ncare_site, location, provider, cost\n\n\nDerived Elements\ncondition_era, drug_era, dose_era\n\n\nHealth Economics\npayer_plan_period\n\n\nMetadata\ncdm_source, metadata\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeuralFrame\nThe following NeuralFrame tables are available in the release of the dataset:\n\nCase Diagnoses\nMisc Details\nCase Outcomes\nCase Treatments\n\n\n\nPhillips ISPM\nThe following tables are available in the initial release of the dataset:\n\nPhilips ISPM Aberration\nPhilips ISPM Orders\nPhilips ISPM Specimen\n\n\n\nSTAMP Add-On\n\nSTAMP Add On Data\n\n\n\nEpic Media Server Documents\n\nEpic Media Server Documents\n\n\n\nHIPPO Benchmark\nHIPPO stands for Human-in-the-loop Identification of PHI with Preserved Output. This internal fully identified dataset consists of two tables:\n\nGold Standard Full Text: This table contains the clinical text from which the annotations were gathered. It also contains basic demographic information about the patients to whom the notes refer.\nGold Standard Spans: This table contains the annotated spans where PHI was identified, along with the corresponding labels and the note identifier to which the spans correspond.\n\n\n\nLung Resection CAP Forms\nThis dataset is composed by two groups of tables and one cleaned dataset in QA format:\n\nEPIC Clarity tables: These are the source EPIC Clarity tables required to assemble the information contained in the CAP forms as well as the pathology reports. The description of those\n\nProcessed tables: These are two tables: cap_forms and shc_pathology_reports. The first table contains the structured information with the CAP forms. The second table contains the pathology reports with the individual elements that compose them each one separated.\nQA cleaned dataset: This is a QA dataset where the questions, answers and context and clearly defined. This dataset is formatted as a HuggingFace dataset and can be loaded directly for training.\n\n\n\nPHI Scrubbing Operations Definitions\nIn order to protect patient information, various PHI (Protected Health Information) scrubbing operations are applied to the dataset. These operations are designed to scrub sensitive data elements. Below are the definitions of the PHI scrubbing operations used in this dataset:\n\n\n\n\nPHi-Scrubbing Operation Name\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nNot Stable between Data Refreshes\nNot Stable between Data Refreshes specific to the project and dataset column\n\n\nJitter\nJitter specific to the project and dataset column\n\n\nDel\nDelete the values in this Column\n\n\nSub\nSubstitute with a value specific to the project and dataset column\n\n\nWhitelist\nOnly allow the values in the ‘allowed list’ table to pass through; otherwise replace with NULL\n\n\nHash\nReplace with a hash value based on a hashing function specific to the project and dataset column\n\n\nTiDE\nPass through TiDE, Stanford’s text PHI scrubbing algorithm\n\n\nRedZip\nReduce the Zipcode precision based on Stanford’s University Privacy Office guidelines as outlined here, Sec 1.4\n\n\nDrop\nDrop this column in the PHI scrubbed dataset\n\n\nStable Between Data Refreshes\nSubstitute with a stable identifier specific to the project and dataset column that will persist between data refreshes. This may be an integer or alphanumeric based on other requirements of the table\n\n\nNot Stable between Data Refreshes\nSubstitute with an identifier that is only specific and self consistent for that data refresh -could be an integer or alphanumeric based on requirements of the table\n\n\nNone\npass as is- no PHI scrubbing operation\n\n\n\n\n\nDICOM PHI Scrubbing\nFor DICOM data the PHI scrubbing module protects PII and sensitive information through a two-stage process. First, it uses regex patterns to identify and mask specific data types including dates, times, email addresses, URLs, numeric identifiers, and hexadecimal sequences. Second, it tokenizes the text using configurable delimiters and numeric-to-alpha and alpha-to-numeric transitions, then replaces any tokens not found in a predefined allowlist with ‘X’ characters of equivalent length. The system preserves the original text structure by maintaining spacing and delimiters while systematically redacting content. It includes specialized date handling through regex patterns that match various date formats, ensuring that only approved vocabulary passes through unredacted while obscuring all other potentially sensitive information.\nThis redaction only applies to series_description, study_description, and protocol_name attributes (tags).",

In a claims databases, the payment and payment terms reported by the payer for the goods or services billed will generate one cost record. If the source data has payment information for more than one payer (i.e. primary insurance and secondary insurance payment for one entity), then a cost record is created for each reporting payer. Therefore, it is possible for one procedure to have multiple cost records for each payer, but typically it contains one or no record per entity. Payer reimbursement cost records will be identified by using the PAYER_PLAN_ID field. Drug costs are composed of ingredient cost (the amount charged by the wholesale distributor or manufacturer), the dispensing fee (the amount charged by the pharmacy and the sales tax).",

The analysis includes the frequency of different PHI entities and their distribution across documents. This helps to understand the prevalence of various PHI types in the dataset and provides insights into the labeling process. The analysis is divided into two parts: the total count of each PHI entity type and the distribution of PHI entities per document. It is important to clarify that DOCTOR and HOSPITAL are not classified as PHI in the Safe-Harbor definition. However, being able to identify and obfuscate such information may be important for potential data sharing use cases.\n\nOverallPer Document\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote Types\nIn this section, we present an analysis of the different types of clinical notes included in the labeled sample used in our study. We compare these note types with the broader STARR-OMOP population to provide context and highlight any significant differences. This comparison helps to understand the representativeness of the labeled sample and identify the differences in the bias sample in the types of notes included. The analysis includes the distribution of note types and their frequencies in both the labeled sample and the STARR-OMOP population. In the distribution below there are several types that contain radiology and pathology reports. Among those are the notes labeled as procedures. Those are a combination of clinical results that are a result of procedures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistribution of Note Types in the Dataset\n\n\nNote Type\n\nLabeled Sample\n\n\nSTARR-OMOP\n\n\n\nn\n%\nn\n%\n\n\n\n\nletter\n45\n3.23\n45\n3.23\n\n\nimaging\n36\n2.58\n36\n2.58\n\n\nprocedures\n36\n2.58\n36\n2.58\n\n\nprogress notes\n34\n2.44\n34\n2.44\n\n\nclinic support note\n32\n2.30\n32\n2.30\n\n\npatient instructions\n32\n2.30\n32\n2.30\n\n\ndischarge instructions\n31\n2.22\n31\n2.22\n\n\ntelephone encounter\n31\n2.22\n31\n2.22\n\n\nnursing note\n29\n2.08\n29\n2.08\n\n\nconsults\n27\n1.94\n27\n1.94\n\n\ncare plan note\n26\n1.87\n26\n1.87\n\n\nh&p\n26\n1.87\n26\n1.87\n\n\npathology\n26\n1.87\n26\n1.87\n\n\nrtf letter\n26\n1.87\n26\n1.87\n\n\nanesthesia procedure notes\n25\n1.79\n25\n1.79\n\n\nunmapped external results\n24\n1.72\n24\n1.72\n\n\nanesthesia postprocedure evaluation\n23\n1.65\n23\n1.65\n\n\ncare plan\n23\n1.65\n23\n1.65\n\n\necg\n23\n1.65\n23\n1.65\n\n\npathology and cytology\n23\n1.65\n23\n1.65\n\n\nprocedure note\n23\n1.65\n23\n1.65\n\n\nassessment & plan note\n22\n1.58\n22\n1.58\n\n\nlab\n21\n1.51\n21\n1.51\n\n\nrn transfer note\n20\n1.43\n20\n1.43\n\n\nsign out note\n19\n1.36\n19\n1.36\n\n\nunmapped external note\n19\n1.36\n19\n1.36\n\n\npr charge\n18\n1.29\n18\n1.29\n\n\noperative note\n17\n1.22\n17\n1.22\n\n\noperative report\n17\n1.22\n17\n1.22\n\n\nconsult follow-up\n16\n1.15\n16\n1.15\n\n\ndocumentation clarification\n16\n1.15\n16\n1.15\n\n\nmicrobiology\n16\n1.15\n16\n1.15\n\n\ned provider notes\n15\n1.08\n15\n1.08\n\n\ned temp/rap patient\n15\n1.08\n15\n1.08\n\n\nmicrobiology culture\n15\n1.08\n15\n1.08\n\n\nlab panel\n14\n1.00\n14\n1.00\n\n\npoint of care testing\n14\n1.00\n14\n1.00\n\n\ntransplant summary\n14\n1.00\n14\n1.00\n\n\nancillary\n13\n0.93\n13\n0.93\n\n\ngroup note\n13\n0.93\n13\n0.93\n\n\ninterval h&p note\n13\n0.93\n13\n0.93\n\n\nadvance care planning\n12\n0.86\n12\n0.86\n\n\ned notes\n12\n0.86\n12\n0.86\n\n\nip letter\n12\n0.86\n12\n0.86\n\n\nrehab daily note\n12\n0.86\n12\n0.86\n\n\nnursing referral\n11\n0.79\n11\n0.79\n\n\nphysical therapy\n11\n0.79\n11\n0.79\n\n\nanesthesia preprocedure evaluation\n10\n0.72\n10\n0.72\n\n\ner notes\n10\n0.72\n10\n0.72\n\n\nh&p interval\n10\n0.72\n10\n0.72\n\n\nnsg picc refer\n10\n0.72\n10\n0.72\n\n\nperfusion event\n10\n0.72\n10\n0.72\n\n\npft\n10\n0.72\n10\n0.72\n\n\nconsult\n9\n0.65\n9\n0.65\n\n\nimaging non-reportable\n9\n0.65\n9\n0.65\n\n\nneurology\n9\n0.65\n9\n0.65\n\n\nnursing\n9\n0.65\n9\n0.65\n\n\nrehab\n9\n0.65\n9\n0.65\n\n\naccountable care division cm note\n8\n0.57\n8\n0.57\n\n\ndischarge summary\n8\n0.57\n8\n0.57\n\n\nh&p (view-only)\n8\n0.57\n8\n0.57\n\n\nhiv lab non-restricted\n8\n0.57\n8\n0.57\n\n\noutpatient letter\n8\n0.57\n8\n0.57\n\n\nwound care\n8\n0.57\n8\n0.57\n\n\ncode blue/rapid response team note\n7\n0.50\n7\n0.50\n\n\nhealth plan operations cm note\n7\n0.50\n7\n0.50\n\n\nimmediate post op note\n7\n0.50\n7\n0.50\n\n\nlactation note\n7\n0.50\n7\n0.50\n\n\npharmacy medication review\n7\n0.50\n7\n0.50\n\n\nvascular ultrasound\n7\n0.50\n7\n0.50\n\n\nanesthesia post-op follow-up note\n6\n0.43\n6\n0.43\n\n\ncardiac services\n6\n0.43\n6\n0.43\n\n\necho\n6\n0.43\n6\n0.43\n\n\npsych\n6\n0.43\n6\n0.43\n\n\nsignificant event\n6\n0.43\n6\n0.43\n\n\nslp\n6\n0.43\n6\n0.43\n\n\ndermatology\n5\n0.36\n5\n0.36\n\n\ngi\n5\n0.36\n5\n0.36\n\n\nhospice\n5\n0.36\n5\n0.36\n\n\nob\n5\n0.36\n5\n0.36\n\n\nanesthesia post-op\n4\n0.29\n4\n0.29\n\n\nblood bank\n4\n0.29\n4\n0.29\n\n\ndischarge instr -

The analysis includes the frequency of different PHI entities and their distribution across documents. This helps to understand the prevalence of various PHI types in the dataset and provides insights into the labeling process. The analysis is divided into two parts: the total count of each PHI entity type and the distribution of PHI entities per document. It is important to clarify that DOCTOR and HOSPITAL are not classified as PHI in the Safe-Harbor definition. However, being able to identify and obfuscate such information may be important for potential data sharing use cases.\n\nOverallPer Document\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote Types\nIn this section, we present an analysis of the different types of clinical notes included in the labeled sample used in our study. We compare these note types with the broader STARR-OMOP population to provide context and highlight any significant differences. This comparison helps to understand the representativeness of the labeled sample and identify the differences in the bias sample in the types of notes included. The analysis includes the distribution of note types and their frequencies in both the labeled sample and the STARR-OMOP population. In the distribution below there are several types that contain radiology and pathology reports. Among those are the notes labeled as procedures. Those are a combination of clinical results that are a result of procedures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistribution of Note Types in the Dataset\n\n\nNote Type\n\nLabeled Sample\n\n\nSTARR-OMOP\n\n\n\nn\n%\nn\n%\n\n\n\n\nletter\n45\n3.23\n6,889,804\n3.02\n\n\nimaging\n36\n2.58\n27,170,511\n11.90\n\n\nprocedures\n36\n2.58\n2,542,658\n1.11\n\n\nprogress notes\n34\n2.44\n54,086,167\n23.68\n\n\nclinic support note\n32\n2.30\n3,041,493\n1.33\n\n\npatient instructions\n32\n2.30\n9,786,849\n4.29\n\n\ndischarge instructions\n31\n2.22\n1,983,103\n0.87\n\n\ntelephone encounter\n31\n2.22\n38,675,938\n16.94\n\n\nnursing note\n29\n2.08\n1,605,802\n0.70\n\n\nconsults\n27\n1.94\n3,313,915\n1.45\n\n\ncare plan note\n26\n1.87\n4,139,518\n1.81\n\n\nh&p\n26\n1.87\n1,787,536\n0.78\n\n\npathology\n26\n1.87\n1,812,971\n0.79\n\n\nrtf letter\n26\n1.87\n3,549,891\n1.55\n\n\nanesthesia procedure notes\n25\n1.79\n762,798\n0.33\n\n\nunmapped external results\n24\n1.72\n900,521\n0.39\n\n\nanesthesia postprocedure evaluation\n23\n1.65\n915,373\n0.40\n\n\ncare plan\n23\n1.65\n145,491\n0.06\n\n\necg\n23\n1.65\n527,231\n0.23\n\n\npathology and cytology\n23\n1.65\n395,258\n0.17\n\n\nprocedure note\n23\n1.65\n241,589\n0.11\n\n\nassessment & plan note\n22\n1.58\n2,240,039\n0.98\n\n\nlab\n21\n1.51\n24,825,380\n10.87\n\n\nrn transfer note\n20\n1.43\n238,578\n0.10\n\n\nsign out note\n19\n1.36\n2,080,313\n0.91\n\n\nunmapped external note\n19\n1.36\n277,058\n0.12\n\n\npr charge\n18\n1.29\n617,387\n0.27\n\n\noperative note\n17\n1.22\n521,214\n0.23\n\n\noperative report\n17\n1.22\n969,031\n0.42\n\n\nconsult follow-up\n16\n1.15\n1,159,388\n0.51\n\n\ndocumentation clarification\n16\n1.15\n179,822\n0.08\n\n\nmicrobiology\n16\n1.15\n812,474\n0.36\n\n\ned provider notes\n15\n1.08\n1,862,895\n0.82\n\n\ned temp/rap patient\n15\n1.08\n142,004\n0.06\n\n\nmicrobiology culture\n15\n1.08\n1,097,747\n0.48\n\n\nlab panel\n14\n1.00\n118,246\n0.05\n\n\npoint of care testing\n14\n1.00\n368,205\n0.16\n\n\ntransplant summary\n14\n1.00\n1,282,579\n0.56\n\n\nancillary\n13\n0.93\n1,176,069\n0.52\n\n\ngroup note\n13\n0.93\n66,342\n0.03\n\n\ninterval h&p note\n13\n0.93\n200,704\n0.09\n\n\nadvance care planning\n12\n0.86\n97,282\n0.04\n\n\ned notes\n12\n0.86\n6,496,913\n2.85\n\n\nip letter\n12\n0.86\n301,987\n0.13\n\n\nrehab daily note\n12\n0.86\n516,657\n0.23\n\n\nnursing referral\n11\n0.79\n205,098\n0.09\n\n\nphysical therapy\n11\n0.79\n184,380\n0.08\n\n\nanesthesia preprocedure evaluation\n10\n0.72\n1,148,683\n0.50\n\n\ner notes\n10\n0.72\n43,442\n0.02\n\n\nh&p interval\n10\n0.72\n244,086\n0.11\n\n\nnsg picc refer\n10\n0.72\n127,275\n0.06\n\n\nperfusion event\n10\n0.72\n13,641\n0.01\n\n\npft\n10\n0.72\n172,001\n0.08\n\n\nconsult\n9\n0.65\n533,155\n0.23\n\n\nimaging non-reportable\n9\n0.65\n1,584,644\n0.69\n\n\nneurology\n9\n0.65\n112,384\n0.05\n\n\nnursing\n9\n0.65\n19,401\n0.01\n\n\nrehab\n9\n0.65\n657,127\n0.29\n\n\naccountable care division cm note\n8\n0.57\n143,998\n0.06\n\n\ndischarge summary\n8\n0.57\n1,040,761\n0.46\n\n\nh&p (view-only)\n8\n0.57\n171,763\n0.08\n\n\nhiv lab non-restricted\n8\n0.57\n25,412\n0.01\n\n\noutpatient letter\n8\n0.57\n307,086\n0.13\n\n\nwound care\n8\n0.57\n46,420\n0.02\n\n\ncode blue/rapid response team note\n7\n0.50\n8,238\n0.00\n\n\nhealth plan operations cm note\n7\n0.50\n37,015\n0.02\n\n\nimmediate post op note\n7\n0.50\n83,068\n0.04\n\n\nlactation note\n7\n0.50\n274,944\n0.12\n\n\npharmacy medication review\n7\n0.50\n50,057\n0.02\n\n\nvascular ultrasound\n7\n0.50\n78,447\n0.03\n\n\nanesthesia post-op follow-up note\n6\n0.43\n50,193\n0.02\n\n\ncardiac services\n6\n0.43\n40,949\n0.02\n\n\necho\n6\n0.43\n642,794\n0.28\n\n\npsych\n6\n0.43\n386,747\n0.17\n\n\nsignificant event\n6\n0.43\n8,713\n0.00\n\n\nslp\n6\n0.43\n82,010\n0.04\n\n\ndermatology\n5\n0.36\n5,511\n0.00\n\n\ngi\n5\n0.36\n317,911\n0.14\n\n\nhospice\n5\n0.36\n4,221\n0.00\n\n\nob\n5\n0.36\n41,869\n0.02\n\n\nanesthesia post-op\n4\n0.29\n88,070\n0.04\n\n\nblood bank\n4\n0.29\n21,218\n0.01\n\n\ndischarge instr -

Specifically, Thoracic Tumor Board patients are identified based on their primary site descriptions in the Neural Frame diagnoses data, which include diagnoses of lung, bronchus, or thymus cancers in addition to having a Tumor Board encounter.\nNote: Thoracic Tumor Board definition will be narrowed further due to observations from cross-comparison between encounter data in Epic Hyperspace versus Epic Clarity.\nAs of May 2025, From 12,975 patients with thoracic cancer, 2,662 also had a Tumor Board encounter.\n\n\nSummary of Patient Population\nThe demographic categories examined include Age, Sex, Race, and Ethnicity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThoracic Tumor Board\n\n\nCharacteristic\n\nCount (N)\nPercentage (%)\n\n\n\n\nTotal\nTotal number of pts\n2,662\n100\n\n\nAge\n0-17\n2\n0\n\n\nAge\n18-44\n92\n3\n\n\nAge\n45-64\n627\n24\n\n\nAge\n65+\n1,941\n73\n\n\nSex\nMale\n1,222\n46\n\n\nSex\nFemale\n1,439\n54\n\n\nSex\nUnknown\n1\n0\n\n\nRace\nAmerican Indian-Alaska Native\n8\n0\n\n\nRace\nAsian\n834\n31\n\n\nRace\nNative Hawaii\n26\n1\n\n\nRace\nBlack\n71\n3\n\n\nRace\nWhite\n1,420\n53\n\n\nRace\nOther-Unknown\n303\n11\n\n\nEthnicity\nHispanic Latino\n193\n7\n\n\nEthnicity\nNOT Hispanic Latino\n2,407\n90\n\n\nEthnicity\nOther-Missing\n62\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeural Frame Case Status\nThe Stanford Cancer Registry keeps track of every cancer case at Stanford and uses the case status variable to monitor each case’s progress. The major categories are: Completed, Not Reportable, and Incomplete.\n\nNot Reportable cases refer to cases that are not reportable to the state per cancer registry rules, or those that have already been abstracted.\nIncomplete cases are reportable and have been abstracted, but are marked as incomplete due to pending treatment information or unresolved edit errors. These edits can arise for a variety of reasons, such as version changes by the state registry or code updates by standard-setting agencies.\nCompleted cases are reportable, have been fully abstracted, and have passed all edit checks. These cases are transmitted to the state.\n\nPlease note that the Incomplete case status is eventually updated to either Completed or Not Reportable.\nThe distribution of case status for Thoracic Tumor Board encounter patients are listed below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCase Status\nNumber of Patients\n\n\n\n\nNot Reportable\n304\n\n\nIncomplete\n130\n\n\nComplete\n2,228\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage Occurrence\nAs of May 2025, 2,659 with thoracic tumor board encounter had image occurrence procedures.\n\nAnatomic SitesModality Types\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: The following modality source values without image pixel were excluded from the analysis:\nSR: Structured Report, REG: Registration, KO: Key Object Selection, PR: Presentation State"

Each entry in the table includes the following key components:\n\nAberration Types: An aberration type describes a specific change to DNA. These are specific alterations in DNA that can affect gene function and contribute to various diseases. Each type represents a distinct change, such as missense variant, deletions, duplications, or point mutations.\nChromosomes: This field indicates the chromosomal location of the gene associated with the aberration. For example if a gene is located on chromosome 17, it will be presented as “chr17”.\nHGNC Gene and Detected Mutations: The HGNC (HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee) provides standardized names for human genes. Detected mutations refer to specific changes found in these genes that may be important for specific therapies, such as gene therapy or personalized medicine.\n\n\nAll Cancer TypesThoracic Cancer\n\n\nThe following analysis displays the genes distribution of positive aberration above 200 cases.\n\nBarplotHeatmap\n\n\nHGNC Gene Distribution:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary Table of HGNC Gene Distribution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenes Distribution by Chromosomes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistribution of Genes by Aberration Type\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThoracic cancer patients are identified based on their primary site descriptions in the Neural Frame diagnoses data, which include diagnoses of lung, bronchus, or thymus cancers.\nFrom 0 unique thoracic patients, 2,517 patients were included in Philips ISPM database with 2,500 aberration cases.\n\nDistribution of Gene Types by Pathogenicity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKRAS Mutations\nThe KRAS gene is a critical component in cell signaling pathways that regulate cell growth and division, and mutations in this gene are frequently associated with various cancers including thoracic cancers.

As of January 2022, the KACI® application from NeuralFrame was approved for abstracting and transmitting diagnosed cases, with Stanford adopting it in 2023. Neural Frame connects to EPIC to extract relevant data, including pathology notes.\nWithin Neural Frame, Class of Case (CoC) divides cases into two groups: cancer cases are categorized as Analytic (reportable with complete data) or Non-analytic (not reportable by law, with complete data only from 2022 onward).\n\nAnalytic: Analytic cases include patients with initial diagnoses and full or partial treatments at Stanford. Analytic cases (codes 00-22) are those that are required by CoC to be abstracted because of the program’s primary responsibility in managing the cancer. Analytic cases are grouped according to the location of diagnosis and treatment.\nNon-analytic: Non-analytic cases include recurrences, consults only, and in-transit patients. Non-analytic cases (codes 30-49 and 99) can be abstracted by the facility to fulfill central registry requirements or upon request from the facility’s cancer program. The grouping of non-analytic cases is based on the reason for their classification, whether they received care at the facility or were abstracted for other reasons.",
