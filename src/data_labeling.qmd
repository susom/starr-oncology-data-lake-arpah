This page provides an overview of our data labeling initiatives focused on extracting structured information from unstructured clinical data. 

## PHI Labeling

Our current focus is on labeling Protected Health Information (PHI) in clinical notes. This project is crucial for:

- Developing robust de-identification systems
- Ensuring patient privacy compliance
- Creating high-quality training data for machine learning models
