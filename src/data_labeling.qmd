This page provides an overview of our data labeling initiatives focused on extracting structured information from unstructured clinical data. 

## PHI Labeling

Our current focus is on labeling Protected Health Information (PHI) in clinical notes. This project is crucial for:

- Developing robust de-identification systems
- Ensuring patient privacy compliance
- Creating high-quality training data for machine learning models

## AI for Automatic Synoptic Reporting

Our team is using AI models to automatically extract structured information from pathology reports. Key aspects of this work include:

- Identifying key data elements from College of American Pathologists (CAP) cancer protocols
- Converting unstructured free-text reports into standardized synoptic formats
- Validating model accuracy against human expert annotation

This initiative aims to improve data standardization, reduce manual extraction efforts, and enhance the completeness of cancer registry data.
