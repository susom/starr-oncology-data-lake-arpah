## **Introduction**

In this report, we outline the methodology used to create a labeled dataset with annotated PHI from clinical notes. Specifically, we describe the process for sampling clinical notes and performing annotations. This process was designed to achieve the following objectives:

* Ensuring demographic representation across diverse patient populations  
* Maintaining consistency in annotation across multiple annotators  
* Balancing efficiency with quality in the annotation process  
* Managing the resource-intensive nature of medical text annotation

[Figure 1](fig-labeling-process) provides an overview of the labeling process.

## **Data Sampling Methodology**

The data sampling was performed in two steps. First, we conducted a random sampling across the entire set of notes. Then, we applied diversity sampling using a set cover algorithm. The details of these procedures are outlined below.

### **Note Characteristics Analysis**

The sampling process incorporates textual characteristics to ensure diversity in content:

* **Note titles** are categorized to represent different types of clinical documentation.  
* **Note length distribution** is analyzed using a binning approach:  
  * Calculation of the median length per note title  
  * Computation of the median of medians  
  * Selection of notes between the 25th and 75th percentiles  
  * Quantization into four distinct bins for balanced representation

### **Set Cover Algorithm Implementation**

To optimize sampling while maintaining representation across all demographic and textual characteristics, we implemented a modified set cover algorithm:

* Initial random sampling of 1M notes to create a computationally manageable subset  
* Application of a set cover algorithm to ensure representation across all defined partitions  
* Optimization for maximum coverage with minimal redundancy

## **Annotation Guidelines Development**

### **Guideline Structure**

Comprehensive annotation guidelines were developed through an iterative process. These guidelines include:

* Clear definitions of annotation targets  
* Explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria  
* Representative examples  
* Decision trees for ambiguous cases  
* Standard operating procedures for the annotation workflow

The labeling guidelines can be found [here](phi_labeling_guidelines.qmd). 

### **Guideline Validation**

The guidelines underwent multiple validation cycles, including:

* Pilot testing with experienced annotators  
* Refinement based on inter-annotator agreement analysis  
* Integration of edge cases identified during initial annotation phases

## **Pre-labeling and Annotation Distribution Process**

### **LLM Pre-Annotation Implementation**

The pre-labeling process utilized GPT-4 via Azure’s API (version 2023-05-15), incorporating:

* Prompt engineering optimized using the I2B2 dataset  
* Integration of annotation guidelines into prompt design  
* Systematic validation of pre-labeled outputs

### **Annotation Distribution**

Notes were assigned following a structured protocol:

* **Random assignment** to ensure unbiased distribution  
* **Dual annotator requirement** for each note to enable quality assessment  
* **Tracking system implementation** to monitor annotation progress  
* **Regular checkpoints** for interim quality assessments

## **Quality Control Framework**

The quality assessment framework employs a bilateral F1 measure approach:

* **Primary F1 calculation:**  
  * Annotator A's labels serve as the ground truth against Annotator B’s annotations  
  * Annotator B's labels serve as the ground truth against Annotator A’s annotations  
  * The final F1 score is computed as the arithmetic mean of both directions

#### **Adjudication Process**

All clinical notes without 100% agreement across annotated spans undergo an adjudication process. Experienced annotators review and resolve disagreements to ensure annotation quality. Only the notes with 100% agreement or adjudicated notes are used as gold standard.
