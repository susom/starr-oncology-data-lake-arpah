### Columns Description

##### specimen_id

A unique identifier for each specimen.

##### person_id

A foreign key identifier to the Person for whom the Specimen is recorded.

##### specimen_concept_id

A foreign key referring to a Standard Concept identifier in the Standardized Vocabularies for the Specimen.

##### specimen_type_concept_id

A foreign key referring to the Concept identifier in the Standardized Vocabularies reflecting the system of record from which the Specimen was represented in the source data.

##### specimen_date

The date the specimen was obtained from the Person.

##### specimen_datetime

The date and time on the date when the Specimen was obtained from the person.

##### quantity

The amount of specimen collection from the person during the sampling procedure.

##### unit_concept_id

A foreign key to a Standard Concept identifier of measurement units in the Standardized Vocabularies.

##### anatomic_site_concept_id

A foreign key to a Standard Concept identifier for the anatomic location of specimen collection in the Standardized Vocabularies.

##### disease_status_concept_id

A foreign key to a Standard Concept identifier for the Disease Status of specimen collection in the Standardized Vocabularies.

##### specimen_source_id

The Specimen identifier as it appears in the source data.

##### specimen_source_value

The Specimen value as it appears in the source data. The value is mapped to a Standard Concept in the Standardized Vocabularies and the original code is stored here for reference.

##### unit_source_value

The information about the Unit as detailed in the source.

##### anatomic_site_source_value

The information about the anatomic site as detailed in the source.

##### disease_status_source_value

The information about the disease status as detailed in the source.

## Conventions
- Each specimen should have a corresponding record in the PERSON table
- specimen_concept_id should use Standard Concepts from the Specimen domain
- Anatomic site and disease status provide important context for specimen interpretation
- Source values preserve original coding from the source system
