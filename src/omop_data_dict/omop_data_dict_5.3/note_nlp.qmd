### Columns Description

##### note_nlp_id

A unique identifier for the NLP record.

##### note_id

A foreign key to the Note table note the NLP record is associated to.

##### section_concept_id

A foreign key to the predefined Concept in the Standardized Vocabularies representing the section of the extracted text.

##### snippet

A small window of text surrounding the term as it appears in the source document.

##### offset

Character offset of the extracted term in the source document.

##### lexical_variant

Raw text extracted from the NLP tool.

##### note_nlp_concept_id

A foreign key to the predefined Concept in the Standardized Vocabularies reflecting the normalized concept for the extracted term. Maps to the same domain of the extracted term.

##### note_nlp_source_concept_id

A foreign key to a Concept that refers to the code in the source vocabulary used by the NLP system.

##### nlp_system

Name and version of the NLP system that extracted the term. Useful for data provenance.

##### nlp_date

The date of the note processing.

##### nlp_datetime

The date and time of the note processing.

##### term_exists

A summary modifier that signifies presence or absence of the term for a given patient. Useful for quick querying. 'Y', 'N', or NULL.

##### term_temporal

An optional time modifier associated with the extracted term. (e.g. "history of" = past, "future" = future, null = present).

##### term_modifiers

A compact description of all the modifiers of the specific term extracted by the NLP system. (e.g. "son has rash" = negated=no,subject=family, certainty=undef,conditional=false,general=false).

## Conventions
- Each NLP extraction should be linked to a specific NOTE record
- Multiple NLP records can be associated with a single note
- The lexical_variant contains the actual extracted text as found in the source
- Standardized concepts should be used when possible for note_nlp_concept_id
- Term modifiers capture important contextual information like negation, uncertainty, and temporality
