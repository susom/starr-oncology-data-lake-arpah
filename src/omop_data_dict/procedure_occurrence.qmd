### Columns Description


##### procedure_occurrence_id

A system-generated unique identifier for each Procedure Occurrence.

##### person_id

The person_id of the person for whom the procedure is recorded.

##### procedure_concept_id

A foreign key that refers to a standard procedure Concept identifier in the Standardized Vocabularies.

##### procedure_date

The date on which the Procedure was performed.

##### procedure_datetime

The date and time on which the Procedure was performed.

##### procedure_type_concept_id

This field can be used to determine the provenance of the Procedure record, as in whether the procedure was from an EHR system, insurance claim, registry, or other sources.

##### modifier_concept_id

The modifiers are intended to give additional information about the procedure. 

##### quantity

The quantity of procedures ordered or administered. If the quantity value is omitted, a single procedure is assumed.

##### provider_id

The provider in the PROVIDER table who was responsible for carrying out the procedure.

##### visit_occurrence_id

The visit during which the procedure occurred

##### visit_detail_id

The VISIT_DETAIL record during which the Procedure occurred. For example, if the Person was in the ICU at the time of the Procedure the VISIT_OCCURRENCE record would reflect the overall hospital stay and the VISIT_DETAIL record would reflect the ICU stay during the hospital visit.

##### procedure_source_value

The source code for the Procedure as it appears in the source data. This code is mapped to a standard procedure Concept in the Standardized Vocabularies and the original code is, stored here for reference. Procedure source codes are typically ICD-9-Proc, CPT-4, HCPCS or OPCS-4 codes.

##### procedure_source_concept_id

This is the concept id representing the procedure source value and may not necessarily be standard.

##### modifier_source_value

This field houses the verbatim value from the source data representing the modifier code for the procedure that occurred

##### trace_id (stanford construct for traceability) 

A json string with the primary keys of the table in Clarity where most of the information for a given row is sourced

##### unit_id (stanford construct for traceability) 

Is a reference for the position in the ETL code responsible for bringing in this row data

##### load_table_id (stanford construct for traceability) 

Is the name of the primary Clarity table in Clarity where most of the information for a given row is sourced
