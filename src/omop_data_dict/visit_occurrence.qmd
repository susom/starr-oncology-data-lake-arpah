### Columns Description


##### visit_occurrence_id

A unique identifier for each Person's visit or encounter at a healthcare provider.

##### person_id

A foreign key identifier to the Person for whom the visit is recorded. The demographic details of that Person are stored in the PERSON table.

##### visit_concept_id

A foreign key that refers to a Concept identifier in the Standardized Vocabularies belonging to the 'Visit' Domain (inpatient, emergency room, etc).

##### visit_start_date

The start date of the visit.

##### visit_start_datetime

The date and time when the visit started. This defaults to 00:00:00 (midnight) if no time information is available. 

##### visit_end_date

The end date of the visit. If this is a one-day visit the end date should match the start date.

##### visit_end_datetime

The date and time when the visit ended.This defaults to 00:00:00 (midnight) if no time information is available.

##### visit_type_concept_id

Use this field to understand the provenance of the visit record, or where the record comes from.

##### provider_id

A foreign key to the provider in the provider table who was associated with the visit.

##### care_site_id

A foreign key to the care site in the care site table that was visited.

##### visit_source_value

This column contains a text string that concatenates the fields used to determine the visit_type. The following fields are concatenated in this order, with ‘ | ‘ separators: encounter type (enc_type_c), admission/discharge/transfer patient class (adt_pat_class_c), hospital admission type (hosp_admsn_type_c), and visit type (appt_prc_id)

##### visit_source_concept_id

A foreign key to a Concept that repersents a distinct combination of the following three variables:  ADT patient class, hospital admission type, and encounter type. One or more of these variables may be null for any given visit.

##### admitted_from_concept_id

A foreign key to the predefined concept in the Visit Domain reflecting where the patient was admitted from.

##### admitted_from_source_value

The source code for where the patient was admitted from as it appears in the source data.

##### discharge_to_concept_id

A foreign key to the predefined Concept in the Visit Domain reflecting where the patient was discharged to (discharge disposition).

##### discharge_to_source_value

The source code for the discharge disposition as it appears in the source data.

##### preceding_visit_occurrence_id

A foreign key to the VISIT_OCCURRENCE row of the visit immediately preceding this visit

##### trace_id (stanford construct for traceability) 

A json string with the primary keys of the table in Clarity where most of the information for a given row is sourced

##### unit_id (stanford construct for traceability) 

Is a reference for the position in the ETL code resposible for bringing in this row data

##### load_table_id (stanford construct for traceability) 

Is the name of the primary Clarity table in Clarity where most of the information for a given row is sourced
