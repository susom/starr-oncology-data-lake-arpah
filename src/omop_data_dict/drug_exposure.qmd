### Columns Description


##### drug_exposure_id

A system-generated unique identifier for each Drug utilization event.

##### person_id

A foreign key identifier to the Person who is subjected to the Drug. The demographic details of that Person are stored in the PERSON table.

##### drug_concept_id

The standard concept_id belonging to the 'Drug' domain.that the drug_source_value maps to.

##### drug_exposure_start_date

The start date for the current instance of Drug utilization. Valid entries include a start date of a prescription, the date a prescription was filled, or the date on which a Drug administration procedure was recorded.

##### drug_exposure_start_datetime

The start date and time for the current instance of Drug utilization. Valid entries include a start datetime of a prescription, the date and time a prescription was filled, or the date and time on which a Drug administration procedure was recorded.

##### drug_exposure_end_date

The end date for the current instance of Drug utilization. Depending on different sources, it could be a known or an inferred date and denotes the last day at which the patient was still exposed to Drug.

##### drug_exposure_end_datetime

The end date and time for the current instance of Drug utilization. Depending on different sources, it could be a known or an inferred date and time and denotes the last day at which the patient was still exposed to Drug.

##### verbatim_end_date

The known end date of a drug_exposure as provided by the source.

##### drug_type_concept_id

The type_concept_id can be used to delineate between prescriptions written vs. prescriptions dispensed vs. medication history vs. patient-reported exposure, etc.

##### stop_reason

The reason the Drug was stopped. Reasons include regimen completed, changed, removed, etc.

##### refills

This is only filled in when the record is coming from a prescription written. This field is meant to represent intended refills at time of the prescription.

##### quantity

The quantity of drug as recorded in the original prescription or dispensing record.

An identifier assigned to a particular quantity or lot of Drug product from the manufacturer.

##### provider_id

The Provider associated with drug record, e.g. the provider who wrote the prescription or the provider who administered the drug.

##### visit_occurrence_id

The Visit during which the drug was prescribed, administered or dispensed.

##### visit_detail_id

A foreign key to the Visit Detail in the VISIT_DETAIL table during which the Drug Exposure was initiated.

##### drug_source_value

The source code for the Drug as it appears in the source data. This code is mapped to a Standard Drug concept in the Standardized Vocabularies and the original code is, stored here for reference.

##### drug_source_concept_id

A foreign key to a Drug Concept that refers to the code used in the source.

##### route_source_value

The information about the route of administration as detailed in the source.

##### dose_unit_source_value

The information about the dose unit as detailed in the source.

##### trace_id (stanford construct for traceability) 

A json string with the primary keys of the table in Clarity where most of the information for a given row is sourced

##### unit_id (stanford construct for traceability) 

Is a reference for the position in the ETL code resposible for bringing in this row data

##### load_table_id (stanford construct for traceability) 

Is the name of the primary Clarity table in Clarity where most of the information for a given row is sourced
