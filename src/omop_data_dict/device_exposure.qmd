### Columns Description


##### device_exposure_id

A system-generated unique identifier for each Device Exposure.

##### person_id

A foreign key identifier to the Person who is subjected to the Device. The demographic details of that Person are stored in the PERSON table.

##### device_concept_id

A foreign key that refers to a Standard Concept identifier in the Standardized Vocabularies belonging to the 'Device' domain.

##### device_exposure_start_date

The date the Device or supply was applied or used.

##### device_exposure_start_datetime

The date and time the Device or supply was applied or used.

##### device_exposure_end_date

The date use of the Device or supply was ceased.

##### device_exposure_end_datetime

The date and time use of the Device or supply was ceased.

##### device_type_concept_id

This field can be used to determine the provenance of the record, as in whether the condition was from an EHR system, insurance claim, registry, or other sources.

##### unique_device_id

A UDI or equivalent identifying the instance of the Device used in the Person.

##### quantity

The number of individual Devices used in the exposure.

##### provider_id

A foreign key to the provider in the PROVIDER table who initiated or administered the Device.

##### visit_occurrence_id

A foreign key to the visit in the VISIT_OCCURRENCE table during which the Device was used.

##### visit_detail_id

A foreign key to the visit detail record in the VISIT_DETAIL table during which the Device was used.

##### device_source_value

The source code for the Device as it appears in the source data. This code is mapped to a Standard Device Concept in the Standardized Vocabularies and the original code is stored here for reference.

##### device_source_concept_id

A foreign key to a Device Concept that refers to the code used in the source.

##### trace_id (stanford construct for traceability) 

A json string with the primary keys of the table in Clarity where most of the information for a given row is sourced

##### unit_id (stanford construct for traceability) 

Is a reference to the position in the ETL code resposible for bringing in this row data

##### load_table_id (stanford construct for traceability) 

Is the name of the primary Clarity table in Clarity where most of the information for a given row is sourced
