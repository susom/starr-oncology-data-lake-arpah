### Columns Description


##### image_occurrence_id (pk)

A system-generated unique identifier for each Image Occurrence event

##### person_id (fk)

A foreign key identifier to the Person who is subjected to the Drug. The demographic details of that Person are stored in the PERSON table

##### procedure_occurrence_id

The unique key is given to a procedure record for a person. Links to the Procedure_occurrence table

##### visit_occurrence_id

The unique key is given to the visit record for a person. Links to the Visit_occurrence table

##### anatomic_site_source_value

Anatomical location of the imaging procedure by the medical acquisition device (gross anatomy). It maps the ANATOMIC_SITE_SOURCE_VALUE to a Standard Concept in the Spec Anatomic Site domain. This should be coded at the lowest level of granularit

##### wadors_uri

Web Access to DICOM Objects via Restful Web Services Uniform Resource Identifier on study level

##### local_path

Local path to the folder containing the image object file (access via a storage block
access protocol)

##### image_occurrence_date

The date the imaging procedure occurred

##### image_study_uid

DICOM Study UID(unique identifier). One study can include several series

##### image_series_uid

DICOM Series UID (unique identifier)

##### modality_source_value

A label that defines the imaging procedures and usually refers to the type of imaging device used. It is of the attributes of the DICOM file (e.g., US, CT, MR, PT, DR, CR, NM)

##### _accession_number

A unique identifier assigned to a patient's specimen or procedure order when it is entered into the system. Note that accession numbers may not be unique across departments, but are usually unique across modalities

##### _study_description

Study description as is appears in the DICOM metadata

##### _series_description

Series description as is appears in the DICOM metadata

##### _note_id
A unique identifier for each note.
