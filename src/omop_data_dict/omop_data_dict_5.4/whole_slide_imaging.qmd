Clinical Data Table - Whole Slide Images

A record of whole slide images. Eventually there will likely be three sources of whole slide image files, currently the table contains manually scanned slides that have been deidentified and split into TIFF and JSON files by Roxanna's Lab. Only order_proc_ids that can be linked to pef clarity are included, this is to ensure no HPP or test patients are represented in the table.
