### Columns Description


##### observation_id

A unique identifier for each observation.

##### person_id

A foreign key identifier to the Person about whom the observation was recorded. The demographic details of that Person are stored in the PERSON table.

##### observation_concept_id

A foreign key to the standard observation concept identifier in the Standardized Vocabularies.

##### observation_date

The date the observation was obtained

##### observation_datetime

The date and time the observation was obtained.

##### observation_type_concept_id

This field is used to determine the provenance of the Observation record, as in whether the measurement was from an EHR system, insurance claim, registry, or other sources.

##### value_as_number

This is the numerical value of the Result of the Observation, if applicable and available. 

##### value_as_string

This is the categorical value of the Result of the Observation, if applicable and available

##### value_as_concept_id

The standard concept corresponding to the value of a clinical Observation

##### qualifier_concept_id

This field contains all attributes specifying the clinical fact further, such as as degrees, severities, drug-drug interaction alerts etc.

##### visit_occurrence_id

A foreign key to the visit in the VISIT_OCCURRENCE table during which the observation was recorded.

##### visit_detail_id

A foreign key to the visit in the VISIT_DETAIL table during which the observation was recorded.

##### observation_source_concept_id

A foreign key to a Concept that refers to the code used in the source.

##### unit_source_value

The source code for the unit as it appears in the source data. This code is mapped to a standard unit concept in the Standardized Vocabularies and the original code is, stored here for reference.

##### qualifier_source_value

The verbatim value from the source data representing the qualifier of the Observation that occurred.

##### trace_id (stanford construct for traceability) 

A json string with the primary keys of the table in Clarity where most of the information for a given row is sourced

##### unit_id (stanford construct for traceability) 

Is a reference for the position in the ETL code resposible for bringing in this row data

##### load_table_id (stanford construct for traceability) 

Is the name of the primary Clarity table in Clarity where most of the information for a given row is sourced
