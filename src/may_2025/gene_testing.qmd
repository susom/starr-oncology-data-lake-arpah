## Gene Testing Fields from Neural Frame

The following table summarizes genetic testing and molecular marker fields available in the Neural Frame database:

| Gene/Marker | Description | NAACCR ID |
|------------|-------------|------------|
| ALK | ALK Rearrangement | 3938 |
| BRAF | BRAF Mutational Analysis | 3940 |
| EGFR | EGFR Mutational Analysis | 3939 |
| KRAS | KRAS Mutational Analysis | 3866 |
| NRAS | NRAS Mutational Analysis | 3941 |
| JAK2 | JAK2 Analysis | 3862 |
| PD-L1 | PD-L1 Expression (Lung) | 23004 |
| HER2 | HER2 Overall Summary | 3855 |
| HER2 IHC | HER2 IHC Summary | 3850 |
| HER2 ISH | HER2 ISH Summary | 3854 |
| MSI | Microsatellite Instability | 10026 |
| TMB | Tumor Mutational Burden | 10027 |
| Ki-67 | Ki-67 Proliferation Index | 3863 |
| Brain Markers | Brain Molecular Markers | 3816 |
| Multi-gene | Multigene Signature Method | 3894 |
| Multi-gene Results | Multigene Signature Results | 3895 |

Each of these fields captures specific molecular and genetic characteristics of tumors that may be relevant for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment decisions.

## Genetic Testing from Philips ISPM

The Philips IntelliSpace Precision Medicine (ISPM) database at Stanford provides additional genomic testing information that complements the Neural Frame data. This includes:

- Comprehensive genomic profiling
- Next-generation sequencing (NGS) results
- Additional molecular markers and variants
- Tumor mutational burden (TMB) scores
- Microsatellite instability (MSI) status
- Other actionable mutations and variants

The combination of Neural Frame and Philips ISPM data provides a more complete picture of the molecular characteristics of tumors, helping to inform treatment decisions and research.
