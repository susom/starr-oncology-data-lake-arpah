Welcome to the VISTA Oncology Data Lake project. This datalake brings together data from different clinical modalities and sources including harmonized and standardized Electronic Health Records Data in the OMOP common Data Model, data from the Stanford Cancer Registry, Genomic Data from Philips ISPM, additional STAMP addon metadata with more data types coming soon. This website provides documentation for the datasets released as part of the project. 

### VISTA Cohort: Patient Inclusion Criteria
All patients included in VISTA must be present in **STARR-OMOP**, Stanford’s research-standard representation of the electronic health record (EHR), **and** have documented evidence of cancer-related care or review within the Stanford health system, defined by at least one of the following: 


1. A documented **tumor board** encounter in the source EHR OR
2. A **case record in Stanford’s Cancer Registry dataset, in Neuralframe KACI**


STARR-OMOP contains data from adult and pediatric patients seen across the Stanford hospital ecosystem whose information may be used for research* and who have at least one recorded clinical event—such as a visit, diagnosis, procedure, medication, laboratory result, imaging event, or clinical note—since January 1, 2000. We include unsigned notes- which is often the case when tumor board documentation exists. The source data for STARR -OMOP are the Adult and Pediatric EPIC Clarity databases and include Stanford HealthCare, Stanford HealthCare Tri-Valley, University Healthcare Alliance or  Stanford Medicine Partners, Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital, and Packard Children's Health Alliance.     

A patient is classified as having a tumor board encounter in STARR OMOP if the visit type contains the text “tumor board”, (irrespective of capitalization). 
Stanford’s Cancer Registry (SCR), currently managed by Neuralframe KACI, includes cancer cases from both adult and pediatric hospitals. The registry contains analytic and non-analytic cases dating back to 1988, has been maintained on multiple platforms over time, and contributes data to the California Cancer Registry (CCR). While CCR requirements have evolved over time, the SCR includes the following types of patients: 

- Analytic cases  - which include patients whose first course of cancer treatment occurred at Stanford regardless of diagnosis location, as well as patients diagnosed at Stanford, even if then treated elsewhere. Note that in the latter case, our data may be incomplete.

- Non-Analytic cases -  included since 2024, which capture additional cancer-related encounters such as patients treated at Stanford only for recurrence, patients followed at Stanford and found to be cancer-free, and patients neither diagnosed nor treated at Stanford (e.g., consultation-only or end-of-life care). 

*Not all EHR data is allowed for research- for more details, see the [STARR Electronic Health Record documentation](https://starr.stanford.edu/data-types/electronic-health-record).

### Dataset Overview

#### Oncology-OMOP 

The OMOP-CDM is a standardized data model designed to facilitate the analysis and sharing of healthcare data across different institutions and studies. By using a common structure and terminology, the OMOP-CDM enables researchers to perform large-scale observational research and generate real-world evidence. 

Our EHR data was initially standardized using OMOP CDM version 5.3.1 and subsequently upgraded to OMOP CDM version 5.4.2 to leverage the latest data model enhancements. For more details about the November 2025 upgrade and data evolution across releases, see the [Data Evolution Overview](data_evolution_overview.qmd) page.

The identified dataset is created using EPIC Clarity tables, which include patient and encounter data permissible for research. The tables in the OMOP-CDM common data model that are part of this dataset are listed in the [Data Dictionary](data_dictionary.qmd) page, along with information on whether they contain PHI and a brief description of each table.


#### NeuralFrame

NeuralFrame data encompasses research-eligible patients who have case records in the Neural Frame, also known as the Stanford Cancer Registry. This dataset is categorized into four main areas:

- **Outcome**: This category includes information related to patient outcomes, such as survival rates, disease progression, and overall health status.

- **Diagnoses**: This section contains details about the diagnoses made for each patient, including cancer types, staging, and any relevant comorbidity.

- **Treatment**: This category outlines the various treatments administered to patients, including surgical interventions, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and other therapeutic approaches.

- **Miscellaneous**: This section includes additional data that may not fit into the other categories, such as demographic information, patient-reported outcomes, and other relevant clinical data.

#### Philips ISPM

- **Philips ISPM Orders**: This table contains order-level information from the Philips IntelliSpace Precision Medicine (ISPM) genomics database at Stanford. The fields in this table are related to diagnostic orders, patient demographics, and specimen accession numbers which can be used to link to the other Philips ISPM tables. 

- **Philips ISPM Aberration**: This table contains genomic testing information from the Philips IntelliSpace Precision Medicine (ISPM) genomics database at Stanford. The fields in this table are related to genomic testing details about each sample, as well as the specimen accession number which can be used to link to the Philips ISPM Orders table.

- **Philips ISPM Specimen**: This table includes specimen-related information from the Philips IntelliSpace Precision Medicine (ISPM) genomics database at Stanford. The fields in this table are related to specimen details, including accession numbers and collection information.

- Following assays are included in the Philips ISPM data:

  - **STAMP**: The Stanford Actionable Mutation Panel for Solid Tumors (STAMP) is a targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay designed to detect clinically actionable mutations as well as other genes frequently altered in cancer. STAMP employs a target enrichment-based sequencing method to capture specific genomic regions of interest. The sequencing approach and integrated bio informatics pipeline are optimized for ultra-deep sequencing of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor biopsy specimens. This panel focuses on clinically actionable genes, selected based on:

    - **Gene Selection Criteria**:
        - Their utility as targets of current or emerging anti-cancer therapies
        - Their prognostic value
        - Their mutation frequency across known cancer types

    - **Technical Specifications**:
        - Sequencing is performed using an **Illumina** platform
        - Minimum limit of detection (LOD) of **5% variant allele frequency (VAF)**
        - Genomic coordinates reported relative to **GRCh37 (hg19)**

   - **Heme-STAMP**: The Stanford Actionable Mutation Panel for Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Malignancies (Heme-STAMP) is a targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay designed to detect single nucleotide variants (SNVs), short insertion–deletions (indels), and selected gene fusions across 203 genes recurrently altered in myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms. Heme-STAMP employs a target enrichment–based sequencing method, beginning with acoustic shearing of genomic DNA, followed by sequencing library preparation and capture of genomic regions of interest using custom-designed oligonucleotide probes.

      - **Gene Selection Criteria**:
        - Clinical relevance as targets of existing or emerging anti-cancer therapies
        - Prognostic significance in hematopoietic malignancies
        - Recurrence frequency across patients with myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms
      - **Technical Specifications**:
        - Sequencing performed on an Illumina platform
        - Minimum limit of detection (LOD) of 5% variant allele frequency (VAF) for SNVs and indels
        - Targets 203 genes (either fully or partially covered)
        - Pooled libraries prepared through acoustic shearing and targeted enrichment

   - **FoundationOne Heme** is designed to include genes known to be somatically altered in human hematologic malignancies and sarcomas that are validated targets for therapy, either approved or in clinical trials, and/or that are unambiguous drivers of oncogenesis based on current knowledge. The current assay utilizes DNA sequencing to interrogate 406 genes as well as selected introns of 31 genes involved in rearrangements, in addition to RNA sequencing of 265 genes. The assay will be updated periodically to reflect new knowledge about cancer biology.

   - **FoundationOne CDx™ (F1CDx)** is a next generation sequencing based in vitro diagnostic device for detection of substitutions, insertion and deletion alterations (indels), and copy number alterations (CNAs) in 324 genes and select gene rearrangements, as well as genomic signatures including microsatellite instability (MSI) and tumor mutational burden (TMB) using DNA isolated from formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue specimens.

   - **FoundationOne Liquid CDx** is a qualitative next generation sequencing based in vitro diagnostic test that uses targeted high throughput hybridization-based capture technology to detect and report substitutions, insertions and deletions (indels) in 311 genes, including rearrangements in eight (8) genes, and copy number alterations in three (3) genes. FoundationOne Liquid CDx utilizes circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) isolated from plasma derived from anti-coagulated peripheral whole blood of cancer patients. 

#### STAMP Add-On

- The STAMP Add-On includes the ‘assay performed’ value, which specifies the type of STAMP test result; For example, the Stanford Actionable Mutation Panel for Solid Tumors (STAMP, Order Code: [STAMPT](https://stanfordlab.com/test-details/s/STAMPT.html) or Heme-STAMP, which includes both Heme-STAMP, Blood (Order Code: [HSTAMPB](https://stanfordlab.com/content/stanfordlab/en/test-details/h/HSTAMPB.html)) and Heme-STAMP, Non-Blood (Order Code: [HSTAMPT](https://stanfordlab.com/content/stanfordlab/en/test-details/h/HSTAMPT.html). In addition, the Add-On contains pipeline version information, along with patient identifiers and accession numbers.

#### HIPPO Benchmark
