Welcome to the VISTA Oncology Data Lake project. This website provides documentation for the datasets released as part of the project. 

### Dataset Overview

#### Oncology-OMOP

The OMOP-CDM is a standardized data model designed to facilitate the analysis and sharing of healthcare data across different institutions and studies. By using a common structure and terminology, the OMOP-CDM enables researchers to perform large-scale observational research and generate real-world evidence. As part of this project we are using OMOP CDM 5.3.1 version. 

The identified dataset is created using EPIC Clarity tables, which include patient and encounter data permissible for research. The tables in the OMOP-CDM common data model that are part of this dataset are listed in the [Data Dictionary](data_dictionary.qmd) page, along with information on whether they contain PHI and a brief description of each table.

#### NeuralFrame

NeuralFrame data encompasses research-eligible patients who have case records in the Neural Frame, also known as the Stanford Cancer Registry. This dataset is categorized into four main areas:

- **Outcome**: This category includes information related to patient outcomes, such as survival rates, disease progression, and overall health status.

- **Diagnoses**: This section contains details about the diagnoses made for each patient, including cancer types, staging, and any relevant comorbidity.

- **Treatment**: This category outlines the various treatments administered to patients, including surgical interventions, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and other therapeutic approaches.

- **Miscellaneous**: This section includes additional data that may not fit into the other categories, such as demographic information, patient-reported outcomes, and other relevant clinical data.

#### Philips ISPM

- **Philips ISPM Orders**: This table contains order-level information from the Philips IntelliSpace Precision Medicine (ISPM) genomics database at Stanford. The fields in this table are related to diagnostic orders, patient demographics, and specimen accession numbers which can be used to link to the other Philips ISPM tables.

- **Philips ISPM Aberration**: This table contains genomic testing information from the Philips IntelliSpace Precision Medicine (ISPM) genomics database at Stanford. The fields in this table are related to genomic testing details about each sample, as well as the specimen accession number which can be used to link to the Philips ISPM Orders table.

- **Philips ISPM Specimen**: This table includes specimen-related information from the Philips IntelliSpace Precision Medicine (ISPM) genomics database at Stanford. The fields in this table are related to specimen details, including accession numbers and collection information.

- **STAMP**: The **Stanford Actionable Mutation Panel for Solid Tumors (STAMP)** is a targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay designed to detect clinically actionable mutations as well as other genes frequently altered in cancer. STAMP employs a target enrichment-based sequencing method to capture specific genomic regions of interest. The sequencing approach and integrated bio informatics pipeline are optimized for ultra-deep sequencing of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor biopsy specimens. This panel focuses on clinically actionable genes, selected based on:

    - **Gene Selection Criteria**:
        - Their utility as targets of current or emerging anti-cancer therapies
        - Their prognostic value
        - Their mutation frequency across known cancer types

    - **Technical Specifications**:
        - Sequencing is performed using an **Illumina** platform
        - Minimum limit of detection (LOD) of **5% variant allele frequency (VAF)**
        - Genomic coordinates reported relative to **GRCh37 (hg19)**



#### Dataset Releases

We periodically release updated versions of our datasets to ensure that researchers have access to the most current and comprehensive data available. Below are the details of our latest dataset releases:

* [February 2025](feb_2025/released_datasets.qmd)
* [May 2025](may_2025/released_datasets.qmd)
* [August 2025](aug_2025/released_datasets.qmd)

## Data Privacy and Security

We prioritize patient privacy and data security. Our datasets undergo rigorous phi scrubbing processes. Most vocabulary tables contain standard terminology, do not vary between institutions, and do not contain any PHI. We have included all populated tables in the CDM, along with descriptions of the fields, on this website.
