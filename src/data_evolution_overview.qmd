This page provides an overview of the VISTA Oncology Data Lake's evolution across multiple releases, showcasing the progressive expansion and maturation of our comprehensive cancer research platform. The data lake has grown substantially from February 2025 through November 2025, with significant increases in patient coverage, data source integration, and analytical capabilities.

## Release Overview

The VISTA Oncology Data Lake represents a multi-institutional effort to create a comprehensive, longitudinal cancer research resource. Through systematic data releases, we have built an increasingly robust platform that integrates clinical, imaging, genomic, and registry data to support advanced cancer research and outcomes analysis.

**Key Growth Highlights:**
- **Patient Cohort Expansion**: From approximately 200,000 patients in February 2025 to over xxx patients by November 2025
- **Enhanced Data Integration**: Progressive addition of NeuralFrame registry data, imaging occurrences, and molecular testing results
- **Improved Clinical Coverage**: Expanding availability of structured clinical data, pathology reports, and tumor board documentation
- **Specialized Sub-Cohorts**: Development of thoracic cancer and other disease-specific research cohorts

### February 2025 - Foundation Release

The inaugural February 2025 release established the core OMOP5.3-CDM foundation of our data lake, providing:

- **Core OMOP Dataset**: Comprehensive patient demographics, encounters, diagnoses, and procedures following OMOP CDM 5.3.1 standards
- **Clinical Infrastructure**: Essential clinical data including medications (RxNorm), laboratory results (LOINC), and procedure codes (CPT)
- **Quality Framework**: Initial data validation and PHI scrubbing processes to ensure research readiness
- **Patient Base**: Approximately 200,000+ oncology patients forming the foundational cohort

This release prioritized data quality and standardization, establishing the structural foundation for subsequent data integration efforts.

### May 2025 - Integration Expansion

The May 2025 release marked a significant evolution with the integration of multiple specialized data sources:

- **NeuralFrame Integration**: Addition of Stanford Cancer Registry data, providing comprehensive cancer case information including staging, treatments, and outcomes
- **Imaging Data**: Integration of OMOP image occurrence data, linking patients to their diagnostic imaging studies
- **Philips ISPM**: Introduction of molecular testing data including STAMP, Heme-STAMP, and FoundationOne results
- **Enhanced Coverage**: Substantial increase in patient coverage across multiple data domains

This release transformed the data lake from a primarily clinical dataset to a multi-modal research platform supporting translational cancer research.

### August 2025 - Depth and Specialization

The August 2025 release focused on increasing data depth and developing specialized research capabilities:

- **Expanded Patient Cohort**: Growth to over 300,000 patients, representing a 50%+ increase from the initial release
- **Clinical Notes Enhancement**: Significant expansion of available pathology reports and clinical documentation
- **Tumor Board Data**: Integration of multidisciplinary tumor board encounter data, providing insights into care coordination
- **CAP Forms Integration**: Addition of structured pathology reporting through College of American Pathologists (CAP) forms
- **Quality Improvements**: Enhanced data validation and standardization processes

This release established the data lake as a comprehensive resource for both population-level and detailed clinical research.

### November 2025 - Advanced Analytics and Specialization
